// LogErrorStack is a developer feature flag to have the LoggedErrorStack
// function in the utils package write out the error stack as defined by the
// errors package to the logger.  The ability to log the error stack is very
// useful in those error cases where you really don't expect there to be a

// stack trace in the log output, but normal deployments never will.
