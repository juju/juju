// Manifold defines the behaviour of a node in an Engine's dependency graph. It's
// named for the "device that connects multiple inputs or outputs" sense of the
// word.
type Manifold struct {

	// Inputs lists the names of the manifolds which this manifold might use.
	// An engine will attempt to start a worker independent of the availability
	// of these inputs, and will restart the worker as the available inputs
	// change. If a worker has no dependencies, it should declare empty inputs.
	Inputs []string

	// Start is used to create a worker for the manifold. It must not be nil.
	// The supplied GetResourceFunc will return ErrMissing for any dependency
	// not named in Inputs, and will cease to function immediately after the
	// StartFunc returns: do not store references to it.
	//
	// Note that, while Start must exist, it doesn't *have* to *start* a worker
	// (although it must return either a worker or an error). That is to say: in
	// *some* circumstances, it's ok to wrap a worker under the management of a
	// separate component (e.g. the `worker/agent` Manifold itself) but this
	// approach should only be used:
	//
	//  * as a last resort; and
	//  * with clear justification.
	//
	// ...because it's a deliberate, and surprising, subversion of the dependency
	// model; and is thus much harder to reason about and implement correctly. In
	// particular, if you write a surprising start func, you can't safely declare
	// any inputs at all.

	// Filter is used to convert errors returned from workers or Start funcs. It
	// can be nil, in which case no filtering or conversion will be done.
	//
	// It's intended to convert domain-specific errors into dependency-specific
	// errors (such as ErrBounce and ErrUninstall), so that workers managed by
	// an Engine don't have to depend on this package directly.
	//
	// It *could* also be used to cause side effects, but remember to be careful;
	// from your perspective, it'll be called from an arbitrary goroutine.

	// Output is used to implement a GetResourceFunc for manifolds that declare
	// a dependency on this one; it can be nil if your manifold is a leaf node,
	// or if it exposes no services to its dependents.
	//
	// If you implement an Output func, be especially careful to expose sensible
	// types. Your `out` param should almost always be a pointer to an interface;
	// and, furthermore, to an interface that does *not* satisfy `worker.Worker`.
	//
	// (Consider the interface segregation principle: the *Engine* is responsible
	// for the lifetimes of the backing workers, and for handling their errors.
	// Exposing those levers to your dependents as well can only encourage them
	// to use them, and vastly complicate the possible interactions.)
	//
	// And if your various possible clients might use different sets of features,
	// please keep those interfaces segregated as well: prefer to accept [a *Foo
	// or a *Bar] rather than just [a *FooBar] -- unless all your clients really
	// do want a FooBar resource.
	//
	// Even if the Engine itself didn't bother to track the types exposed per
	// dependency, it's still a useful prophylactic against complexity -- so
	// that when reading manifold code, it should be immediately clear both what
	// your dependencies *are* (by reading the names in the manifold config)
	// and what they *do* for you (by reading the start func and observing the
	// types in play).

	// in your StartFunc, Abort lets you do so safely.

	//  * else if the named resource has no OutputFunc, it returns ErrMissing;
