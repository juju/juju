/*
This package is for functional testing only. Each feature-set of
Juju should have it's own file in which all the happy-paths are
tested.

Rules:
1) Do NOT mirror the architecture/namespaces of Juju. This should
   be a very flat folder.

2) Whenever possible, do not mock anything. The goal is to test the
   entire stack as well as can be done within a test suite.

3) Avoid writing tests that do not specifically address a
   user-facing feature. The place for that is in unit tests within
   Juju Core.
