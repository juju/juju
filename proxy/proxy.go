// Proxier describes an implemntation of an object that is capable of performing

// and one of the more specific types of proxy's below. Proxy's should be
// considered single use with regards to their Start  and Stop methods and not
// thead safe.

	// Start starts the lifecycle of the proxy. Proxy's should have their start
	// method called before operating with the proxy.
	Start() error

	// Stop stops the proxy after a call to Start(). Proxy's should be
	// considered single use. This call should only ever be made once.

	// RawConfig is responsible for providing a raw configuration representation
	// of the proxier for serialising over the wire.
