Congratulations on installing the Juju client software!

Note that any configuration files created by Juju will be stored in the
'%APPDATA%\Juju' directory. You may wish to include this in regular backups.

In order to deploy applications to a cloud you will also need:

* Credentials for a cloud provider which can instantiate a suitable operating
system image on-demand. This includes services such as Microsoft Azure,
Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, or an OpenStack installation.

* An SSH key-pair. Juju expects to find ssh keys called id_rsa and id_rsa.pub
in a directory called '.ssh' in your home directory. There are instructions on
how to generate these keys at:
