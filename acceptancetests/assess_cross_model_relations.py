"""Functional tests for Cross Model Relation (CMR) functionality.

This test exercises the CMR Juju functionality which allows applications to
communicate between different models (including across controllers/clouds).

The outline of this feature can be found here[1].

This test will exercise the following aspects:
  - Ensure a user is able to create an offer of an applications' endpoint
    including:
      - A user is able to consume and relate to the offer
      - Workload data successfully provided
      - The offer appears in the list-offers output
      - The user is able to name the offer
      - The user is able to remove the offer
  - Ensure an admin can grant a user access to an offer
      - The consuming user finds the offer via 'find-offer'

The above feature tests will be run on:
  - A single controller environment
  - Multiple controllers where each controller is in a different cloud.
