options:
    dataset-size:
        default: '80%'
        description: How much data do you want to keep in memory in the DB. This will be used to tune settings in the database server appropriately. Any more specific settings will override these defaults though. This currently sets innodb_buffer_pool_size or key_cache_size depending on the setting in preferred-storage-engine. If query-cache-type is set to 'ON' or 'DEMAND' 20% of this is given to query-cache-size. Suffix this value with 'K','M','G', or 'T' to get the relevant kilo/mega/etc. bytes. If suffixed with %, one will get that percentage of RAM devoted to dataset and (if enabled) query cache.
        type: string
    preferred-storage-engine:
        default: InnoDB
        type: string
        description: Tune the server for usage of this storage engine. Other possible value is MyISAM. Comma separated will cause settings to split resources evenly among given engines.
    tuning-level:
        default: safest
        type: string
        description: Valid values are 'safest', 'fast', and 'unsafe'. If set to safest, all settings are tuned to have maximum safety at the cost of performance. Fast will turn off most controls, but may lose data on crashes. unsafe will turn off all protections.
    flavor:
        default: distro
        type: string
        description: Possible values are 'distro' or 'percona'
    query-cache-type:
        default: "OFF"
        type: string
        description: Query cache is usually a good idea, but can hurt concurrency. Valid values are "OFF", "ON", or "DEMAND". http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_query_cache_type
    query-cache-size:
        default: -1
        type: int
        description: Override the computed version from dataset-size. Still works if query-cache-type is "OFF" since sessions can override the cache type setting on their own.
    max-connections:
        default: -1
        type: int
        description: Maximum connections to allow. -1 means use the server's compiled in default.
    binlog-format:
        default: 'MIXED'
        type: string
        description: If binlogging is enabled, this is the format that will be used. Ignored when tuning-level == fast.

    ha-mcastport:

        description: |
          Default block storage size to create when setting up MySQL block storage.
          This value should be specified in GB (e.g. 100 not 100GB).
    rbd-name:
        type: string
        default: mysql1
        description: |
          The name that will be used to create the Ceph's RBD image with. If the
          image name exists in Ceph, it will be re-used and the data will be
          overwritten.
