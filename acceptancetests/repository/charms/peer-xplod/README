This is the PEER-XPLOD charm. It likes to make things go 'boom' by just firing hooks constantly.

Overview
--------

This charm doesn't provide a service. It just exists to stress test Juju.

Usage
-----

To stress test Juju, first:

    juju deploy peer-xplod
    juju add-unit -n 10

Watch the hooks fire non-stop. Note that peer-xplod should be an N^2 in the
number of hooks that are firing. So deploying 10 units will trigger on the
order of 100 changes per cycle.

Configuration
-------------

None
