summary: Trigger a firestorm of relation changed events
maintainer: John Arbash Meinel <john.meinel@canonical.com>
description: |
  Every peer connects to every other peer, and on every change, broadcasts an update to its own values.
  This triggers all the other units to wake up and try to do the same.
  You can use the config setting "maximum" to cause the exploding to stop after reaching a certain value.
