        Sometimes it is desirable to avoid sending health checks to servers at
        exact intervals, for instance when many logical servers are located on
        the same physical server. With the help of this parameter, it becomes 
        possible to add some randomness in the check interval between 0 and 
        +/- 50%. A value between 2 and 5 seems to show good results.

        Sets the maximum size of the Diffie-Hellman parameters used for generating
        the ephemeral/temporary Diffie-Hellman key in case of DHE key exchange.
        Default value if 1024, higher values will increase the CPU load, and values
        greater than 1024 bits are not supported by Java 7 and earlier clients. This
        config key will be ignored if the installed haproxy package has no SSL support.

        Sets the default string describing the list of cipher algorithms
        ("cipher suite") that are negotiated during the SSL/TLS handshake for
        all "bind" lines which do not explicitly define theirs. The format of
        the string is defined in "man 1 ciphers" from OpenSSL man pages, and
        can be for instance a string such as "AES:ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL:+RC4:@STRENGTH"
        (without quotes). Please check the "bind" keyword for more information.

  default_retries:

    description: |
        Set the number of retries to perform on a server after a connection
        failure. It is important to understand that this value applies to the
        number of connection attempts, not full requests. When a connection 
        has effectively been established to a server, there will be no more 
        retry.
        In order to avoid immediate reconnections to a server which is 
        restarting, a turn-around timer of 1 second is applied before a retry
        occurs.

                server_options: maxconn 100 cookie S{i} check
    type: string
    description: |
        Services definition(s). Although the variable type is a string, this is
        interpreted in the charm as yaml. To use multiple services within the
        same haproxy instance, specify all of the variables (service_name,
        service_host, service_port, service_options, server_options) with a "-"
        before the first variable, service_name, as above. Service options is a
        comma separated list, server options will be appended as a string to
        the individual server lines for a given listen stanza.

        If your web application serves dynamic content based on users' login
        sessions, a visitor will experience unexpected behaviour if each request
        is proxied to a different backend web server. Session stickiness ensures
        that a visitor 'sticks' to the backend web server which served their
        first request. This is made possible by tagging each backend server
        with a cookie. Session are sticky by default. To turn off sticky sessions,
        remove the 'cookie SRVNAME insert' and 'cookie S{i}' stanzas from
        `service_options` and `server_options`.
  ssl_cert:
    type: string
    description: |
        base64 encoded default SSL certificate. If the keyword 'SELFSIGNED'
        is used, the certificate and key will be autogenerated as
        self-signed. This is the certificate used by services configured
        using keyword 'DEFAULT' as SSL certificate. This config key will be
        ignored if the installed haproxy package has no SSL support.
    default: ""
  ssl_key:
    type: string
    description: |
        base64 encoded private key for the default SSL certificate. If ssl_cert

        Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
        A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
        in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
            juju-postgresql-0
        If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
        this allows you to differentiate between them.
  metrics_target:

  peering_mode:
    default: "active-passive"
    type: string
    description: |
        Possible values : "active-passive", "active-active". This is only used
        if several units are spawned.  In "active-passive" mode, all the units will
        forward traffic to the first working haproxy unit, which will then forward it
        to configured backends. In "active-active" mode, each unit will proxy the
        traffic directly to the backends. The "active-passive" mode gives a better
        control of the maximum connection that will be opened to a backend server.
