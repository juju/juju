Transfers files to/from a Juju machine.`[1:]

The source or destination arguments may either be a local path or a remote
location. The syntax for a remote location is:

    [<user>@]<target>:[<path>]

If the user is not specified, "ubuntu" is used. If <path> is not specified, it
defaults to the home directory of the remote user account.

The <target> may be either a 'unit name' or a 'machine id'. These can be
obtained from the output of "juju status".

Options specific to scp can be provided after a "--". Refer to the scp(1) man
page for an explanation of those options. The "-r" option to recursively copy a
directory is particularly useful.

The SSH host keys of the target are verified. The --no-host-key-checks option
can be used to disable these checks. Use of this option is not recommended as
it opens up the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.

Examples:

Copy file /var/log/syslog from machine 2 to the client's current working
directory:

    juju scp 2:/var/log/syslog .

Recursively copy the /var/log/mongodb directory from a mongodb unit to the
client's local remote-logs directory:

    juju scp -- -r mongodb/0:/var/log/mongodb/ remote-logs

Copy foo.txt from the client's current working directory to an apache2 unit of
model "prod". Proxy the SSH connection through the controller and turn on scp
compression:

    juju scp -m prod --proxy -- -C foo.txt apache2/1:

Copy multiple files from the client's current working directory to machine 2:

    juju scp file1 file2 2:

Copy multiple files from the bob user account on machine 3 to the client's
current working directory:

    juju scp bob@3:'file1 file2' .

Copy file.dat from machine 0 to the machine hosting unit foo/0 (-3
causes the transfer to be made via the client):

    juju scp -- -3 0:file.dat foo/0:
