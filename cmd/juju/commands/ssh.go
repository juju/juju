Initiates an SSH session or executes a command on a Juju machine.`[1:]

var usageSSHDetails = `
The machine is identified by the <target> argument which is either a 'unit
name' or a 'machine id'. Both are obtained in the output to "juju status". If
'user' is specified then the connection is made to that user account;
otherwise, the default 'ubuntu' account, created by Juju, is used.

The optional command is executed on the remote machine. Any output is sent back
to the user. Screen-based programs require the default of '--pty=true'.

The SSH host keys of the target are verified. The --no-host-key-checks option
can be used to disable these checks. Use of this option is not recommended as
it opens up the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack.

Examples:
Connect to machine 0:

    juju ssh 0

Connect to machine 1 and run command 'uname -a':

    juju ssh 1 uname -a

Connect to a mysql unit:

    juju ssh mysql/0

Connect to a jenkins unit as user jenkins:

    juju ssh jenkins@jenkins/0
