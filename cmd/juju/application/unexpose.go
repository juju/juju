Adjusts the firewall rules and any relevant security mechanisms of the

Applications are unexposed by default when they get created. If exposed via
the "juju expose" command, they can be unexposed by running the "juju unexpose"
command.  

If no additional options are specified, the command will unexpose the
application (if exposed). For example, to unexpose the apache2 application,
you can run:

juju unexpose apache2

The --endpoints option may be used to restrict the effect of this command to 
the list of ports opened for a comma-delimited list of endpoints. For instance,
to only unexpose the ports opened by apache2 for the "www" endpoint, you can 
run:

juju unexpose apache2 --endpoints www

Note that when the --endpoints option is provided, the application will still
remain exposed if any other of its endpoints are still exposed. However, if
none of its endpoints remain exposed, the application will be instead unexposed.
