// facadeVersions lists the best version of facades that we want to support. This
// will be used to pick out a default version for communication, given the list
// of known versions that the API server tells us it is capable of supporting.
// This map should be updated whenever the API server exposes a new version (so
// that the client will use it whenever it is available). Removal of an API
// server version can be done when any prior releases are no longer supported.
// Normally, this can be done at major release, although additional thought around
// FullStatus (client facade) and Migration (controller facade) is needed.
// New facades should start at 1.
// We no longer support facade versions at 0.
