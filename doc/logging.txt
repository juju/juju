Logging
=======

The intent of this documentation is to provide an overview of logging in Juju.

Log Rotation
============

all-machines.log
----------------

Juju generates a logrotate configuration file. The configuration file is used when running the logrotate script that is also generated by Juju.
The logrotate script that we generate is used by the rsyslog daemon to trigger the rotation of the all-machines.log file when it has reached a
specific size.

The rotation size of the all-machines.log is 512MB. We keep one copy of the all-machines.log file as all-machines.log.1. This ensures that
the combined size of the main log and a single rotation will not take up more than 1GB of space.
