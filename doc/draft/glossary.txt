Juju Glossary
=============

This document introduces and briefly explains a number of terms that are used
throughout the juju documentation, roughly broken down by conceptual area. The
intent of this document is to make the reader aware of the available modes of
interaction with juju, and how the various commands and concepts interact. It
makes no attempt to be comprehensive; just accurate and opinionated.

Charms
------

A `charm` is a collection of code and data that embodies best practice in
the deployment of a particular piece (or collection) of software. Examples
of software that has been charmed include:

  * wordpress (blogging platform)
  * mediawiki (wiki platform)
  * mysql (relational database)
  * mongodb (non-relational database)
  * hadoop (heavyweight data crunching)
  * glance, keystone, nova-compute, etc (openstack components)
  * minecraft (game server)

A charm consists of the following components:

  * metadata (describes the charm's purpose and capabilities)
  * configuration (describes the ways in which a user can tune the software)
  * hooks (executables, invoked by juju, that configure and deploy the software)
  * revision (an integer identifying separate versions of the same charm)
  * any additional code or data useful to the hooks or the deployed software

A `charm directory` is a filesystem directory containing the aforementioned
components of a charm in standard locations. (Any additional code/data can go
anywhere not reserved for the other components.)

A `charm bundle` is a charm directory serialized as a zip file. This format is
used for storage and distribution only; when a charm is deployed it is always
unbundled into a charm directory, within which all hooks are executed.

A `repository` is a collection of charms that can be deployed by juju.

The `charm store` is the default repository, which serves only curated bundled
charms.

A `local repository` is a repository located on the same system as the juju
client.

A `charm URL` is a string that identifies the provenance and the intended
deployment target of a charm, and may also specify the charm's revision.
Charms are identified by their charm URLs.

Environments
------------

A `machine` is a computing resource on which components of juju, and of the
software deployed by juju, can run. The following command is used to
manipulate machines directly.

  * juju terminate-machine (soon to alias destroy-machine) [TODO: not implemented]

An `environment` is a deployment of juju. It always includes at least one
machine responsible for maintaining the system's state, and potentially
provisioning additional machines in response to state changes. The following
commands are used to manipulate and inspect the environment.

  * juju bootstrap
  * juju status [TODO: somewhat incomplete]
  * juju upgrade-juju
  * juju destroy-environment

An `environment provider` mediates between juju and the substrate on which an
environment runs. Each provider allows juju to run against a different backend:

  * ec2 (Amazon EC2 and S3)
  * maas (bare metal) [TODO: work in progress]
  * local (LXC containers on client machine) [TODO: work in progress]
  * openstack (many public and private clouds) [TODO: work in progress]

An `environment configuration` describes how to create and connect to an
environment from a specific provider. An environment configuration must
always specify at least the following information:

  * name (to identify the environment)
  * type (to specify the provider)
  * admin-secret (a "password" identifying an client with administrative-
    level access to system state)
  * authorized-keys (SSH public keys identifying users allowed to connect to
    machines in the environment)

...and may accept or even require additional keys depending on the provider
type; but the full details of environment configuration are outside the scope
of this document.

[TODO: there should/will be commands for inspecting and manipulating the
configuration of an environment while it's running; the names "env-get" and
"env-set" have been mooted, but I'm not sure that's sane: I can't see any
reason not to use the existing "get" and "set", which currently only work
for services. But I could just be missing something obvious. Note that certain
settings, such as "name" and "type", and "region" in the ec2 provider, will
need to be immutable, and I'm not sure whether that's implemented yet.]

An `environments file` is a YAML file containing environment configurations.
Juju cannot operate without a valid environments file, which must be saved at
`~/.juju/environments.yaml` on the client machine.

The simplest functional environments file looks like this:

  environments:
    aws:
      type: ec2
      admin-secret: <password string>
      control-bucket: <globally unique S3 bucket name>

The "name" of the single defined environment is determined by its key in the
environments map ("aws"), and the "authorized-keys" can be safely omitted so
long as the client machine has a public key with a standard name saved in
`~/.ssh`. Because it's using the "ec2" provider type, it also has to specify
a "control-bucket" key; the "access-key" and "secret-key" settings are also
required, but can be omitted if the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
environment variables are set in the client process. The "region" setting
defaults to "us-east-1"; there are other possible settings but they're not
relevant here.

[NOTE: there is much more to environment configuration than has been discussed
here. "authorized-keys-path" and "default-series" both apply to every provider,
the ec2 provider offers many not mentioned here, and it will only get worse with
each new provider...]

Services
--------

A `service` is a deployment of a charm in an environment. The following commands
are used to manipulate services:

  * juju deploy
  * juju destroy-service [TODO: not implemented]

A service's `configuration` is defined by its charm, and allows the user to
inspect and tune the service's operation using the following commands:

  * juju get
  * juju set

A `unit` is the fundamental component of a service; services are composed of
units. Each unit represents an instance of the charm's software, deployed to
some machine in the service's environment. The following commands are used to
manipulate units:

  * juju add-unit
  * juju remove-unit (soon to alias destroy-unit)

[TODO: units are currently not, but will shortly be, deployed to LXC containers
within their machines; this prevents units on the same machine from interfering
with one another (except when each attempts to open the same port; we haven't
worked out how to deal with that yet).]

A service is `exposed` if it is theoretically accessible from the public
internet (or, at least, from outside its environment). The fact of a service's
exposure does not necessarily imply that any units of that service are actually
accessible; actual access is mediated by the service's units, which are
responsible for specifying the ports that should actually be opened when the
service is exposed. Service exposure is controlled with the following commands:

  * juju expose
  * juju unexpose

[NOTE: the "firewall-mode" environment configuration setting comes into play
here, but that may be a topic for a more detailed document, along with the
varying levels of firewalling support in the various providers.]

A service's charm can be `upgraded` when the revision of that charm available
from its original repository is greater than that or the service's current charm,
and when the following conditions hold:

  * all configuration keys that exist in both versions of the charm must have
    the same data type (addition or removal of config settings is fine, and it's
    ok for defaults to change, but (for example) a string cannot become an
    integer).
  * any normal relations in which the service is participating must also be
    available, unchanged, in the newer version of the charm (addition or removal
    of charm relations is, in general, fine).
  * [TODO: something to do with storage compatibility, but storage doesn't exist
    yet]

The following command is used to upgrade a service's charm:

  * juju upgrade-charm [TODO: not implemented]

[TODO: --revision and --switch params, that do not exist in the python version,
are mooted; they would respectively allow up/downgrades to specific revisions,
and crossgrades to entirely different charms, but priority/agreement is unclear.]

Sometimes (although, hopefully, rarely) a unit will encounter an `error` that
requires human intervention. These cases are as follows:

  * a charm hook returned a non-zero exit code
  * the unit process was killed while running a charm hook
  * a charm upgrade failed due to conflicting content in the charm directory

In each of these situations, the unit stops responding to most external events,
and waits for an administrator to resolve the problem. The administrator may
need to log into the machine with the failed unit to determine and resolve the
problem, or he may be able to resolve the problem automatically by trying to
re-run the failed hook. The following commands are useful in error recovery:

  * juju ssh
  * juju scp
  * juju resolved

A `forced upgrade` is a form of upgrade that ignores unit error states, and
upgrades them anyway. Forced upgrades are subtle and quick to anger; they
are only recommended if you have sole control of your environment and a clear
understanding of the upgrade process as it applies to your specific charm.

Relations
---------

An `interface` is an informally-agreed protocol for transferring information
between service units. Examples include:

  * http (hostname, port)
  * mysql (host, database, user, password, slave)
  * ceph-client (key, auth, rid) [TODO: I don't think rid is appropriate, we
    should take a look and figure out if it could be dropped]

A `role` describes the manner in which a charm uses an interface. A role can
have one of three values: "provider", "requirer", or "peer".

A `(charm) relation` is an entry in a charm's metadata that indicates that it
can fulfil some role over some interface. For example, the "relations" section
of a charm's metadata might look like this (taken from wordpress):

    requires:
      db:
        interface: mysql
      nfs:
        interface: mount
      cache:
        interface: memcache
    provides:
      website:
        interface: http
    peers:
      loadbalancer:
        interface: reversenginx

The above defines five (charm) relations, named "db", "nfs", "cache", "website",
and "loadbalancer". "db" is a "requirer" over the "mysql" interface; "website"
is a "provider" over the "http" interface.

An `endpoint` is the combination of a service with one of its charm's relations.
The set of a service's endpoints define the possible connections involving that
service. Within an environment, an endpoint is uniquely identifiable when
expressed in the form `<service-name>:<charm-relation-name>`.

A "normal" `relation` is a connection between the endpoints of two services.
The services' charms must respectively "provide" and "require" relations with
identical interfaces. When two services are participating in a relation, each
unit of each service can communicate with every unit of the other service.
Normal relations can be manipulated with the following commands:

  * juju add-relation
  * juju remove-relation (soon to alias destroy-relation)

A `(peer) relation` is a connection within a service defined by a single
endpoint with the "peer" role. If such an endpoint exists, the peer relation
is automatically created when the service is deployed; each unit of the
service can communicate with every other unit of the service. Peer relations
cannot be manipulated in the UI, but are displayed in `juju status` output.

The word `relation`, when used casually, *may* refer to a charm relation or a
peer relation, but is most likely to refer to a "normal" relation.

When manipulating relations, it is important to understand that a single
endpoint can participate in multiple relations. For example, a mysql:server
endpoint can quite happily participate in relations with both a wikimedia:db
endpoint and a wordpress:db endpoint (or even in multiple relations with
separate services running their own charms: for example, wordpress1:db and
wordpress2:db). In each case, the mysql charm is responsible for creating
separate users and databases for each separate relation.

[TODO: charm relations also have a concept of "limit" which probably ought to
come in here, but no code respects it at the moment. Oh, and a "required" field
too, and I'm not sure whether anyone fully recalls its precise intended
semantics... not sure what to do about this.]

Subordinates
------------

[TODO: subordinates are not yet implemented in go, but the vast majority of the
building blocks are already integrated.]

A `subordinate charm` is a charm which declares itself to be subordinate.

A `subordinate service` is a service running a subordinate charm.

A `subordinate unit` is a unit of a subordinate service.

All other charms, services, and units are `principal` units, by virtue of not
being subordinate.

A charm relation's `scope` controls which units within a relation are visible
to one another. Most relations have "global" scope, which is the default; a
subordinate charm must define at least one relation with "local" scope.

A normal or peer relation's `scope` is the narrowest scope amongst its
endpoints; a normal relation's scope is "global" unless either endpoint has
"local" scope, in which case it the whole relation has "local" scope, while a
peer relation's single endpoint must always in practice have "global" scope.

When a subordinate service is deployed, no units are created; the add-unit and
remove-unit [TODO: lp:1091634] commands do not apply to subordinate services.
Instead, subordinate units are deployed as a side-effect of the creation of
locally-scoped relations between the subordinate service and others, and
recalled as a result of the destruction of the services or relations they are
dependent upon [TODO: lp:1091865].

To clarify: when a new relation is added and all the following conditions apply:

  * one service is a subordinate;
  * one service is a principal;
  * the relation between the two is locally scoped, by virtue of at least one
    of the endpoints having local scope:

...a new unit of the subordinate service will be created and deployed alongside
each unit of the principal service (unless one already exists). Each principal
unit is responsible for its own associated subordinate, which runs alongside
the principal with essentially identical privileges. Due to the local scoping
of the relation, each subordinate unit responds only to the principal unit that
deployed it, and vice versa.

[TODO: to clarify: once units are deployed inside their own containers, subordinate
units will be installed inside their principal unit's container. But we don't have
containers yet.]

A subordinate service can of course participate in globally-scoped relations as
well; such relations can be added as normal, and the subordinate units participate
in those relations just as in any other global relation.

[NOTE: there's also a magic implicit charm relation, called "juju-info", which
provides the "juju-info" interface and allows subordinates to establish relations
with arbitrary principals. Couldn't really figure out how to work it in nicely.]

Constraints
-----------

[TODO: constraints are not yet implemented in go; a substantial amount of work
needs to be done]

Some environment providers offer the ability to provision machines with varying
characteristics. An environment provider defines a vocabulary of `constraints`
to control the computing resources that are available from the provider; by
specifying global environment constraints and overriding them where necessary
at the service level, a user can ensure that her workloads are only run on
machines with appropriate characteristics.

Available constraints vary by provider, and are manipulated and inspected using
the following commands:

  * juju set-constraints (not implemented)
  * juju get-constraints (not implemented)

Storage
-------

[TODO: storage remains an informally-specified concept distributed across
several brains; don't even try to document it.]

Entity lifecycles
-----------------

When services, relations, units and machines are added and destroyed by the
client, changes to the environment will take some time to occur: in particular,
destruction is rarely instantaneous. Destroyed entities will continue to be
displayed in juju status output but marked as "dying" [TODO: they are not] until
the underlying resources have been removed.

This is not really worth worrying about in general, but it does mean that after
a service or relation has been destroyed you will need to wait until they have
been *removed* before you're able to add a new service or relation with the same
name. It's not an issue for units or machines, because their names are assigned
internally by juju and are guaranteed to be unique.
