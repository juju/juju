Bazaar Basics
=============

An alternative to using `cobzr` is to use the normal `bzr` with light-weight
checkouts (see `bzr help checkouts`).

The first step is to create a repository that contains the juju-core trunk and
other working branches.


The Repository
==============

See `bzr help repositories` for more info on repositories.

For this example, we'll use ~/src as a location for the repository.

  $ cd ~/src
  $ bzr init-repo juju-core

This will create a repository that has working trees (the actual files and
directories - see `bzr help working-trees`.

Now put trunk in there:

  $ cd juju-core
  $ bzr branch lp:juju-core trunk


Working in $GOPATH
==================

Now that we have trunk of juju-core elsewhere, we now need to use it inside
$GOPATH.

These steps assume that you have juju-core already available in $GOPATH/src.

  $ cd $GOPATH/src/launchpad.net/juju-core
  $ bzr reconfigure --lightweight-checkout --bind-to ~/src/juju-core/trunk

Now when you look at that branch, you should see the following

  $ bzr info
  Lightweight checkout (format: 2a)
  Location:
    light checkout root: .
     checkout of branch: /home/<you>/src/juju-core/trunk
      shared repository: /home/<you>/src/juju-core


Making pushes easier
====================

You can specify information in the bazaar locations file which it uses to
determine the locations of the public and push locations for a branch.

Inside your ~/.bazaar/locations.conf file, add the following (not including
the curly braces).

{{{
[/home/eric/src]
public_branch = bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.net/~eric-the-viking
public_branch:policy = appendpath
push_location = lp:~eric-the-viking
push_location:policy = appendpath
}}}

And replace 'eric' with your login id, and 'eric-the-viking' with your
launchpad id.

The `appendpath` policy means that the directories under ~/src are added to
the path, so ~/src/juju-core/trunk would be pushed to (by default)
lp:~eric-the-viking/juju-core/trunk.  What this means is that when you create
a new branch `new-work`, and go `bzr push` it goes to
`lp:~eric-the-viking/juju-core/new-work`.


Making a branch to work in
==========================

Inside the $GOPATH/src/launchpad.net/juju-core directory, you can create a new
branch to work on using:

  $ bzr switch -b new-work

This creates a new branch in `~/src/juju-core` called `new-work` and switches
the working tree to use that.  Commits are now on that new branch, and push
sends it to launchpad to the `new-work` branch.

Everything else works the same.


Useful aliases
==============

  $ bzr alias commit="commit --strict"

This will mean that whenever you use commit, it adds the `--strict` flag.
What this means is that it will not allow you to commit if there are unknown
files.  This is very useful when you create new files but forget to add them
prior to commit.

If you do have unknown files and want to override the strict behaviour for one
commit, then you can go...

  $ bzr commit --no-strict -m "Blah blah"


Another useful alias is:

  $ bzr alias ll="log --line -r-10..-1"

Will give you something like the following:

{{{
