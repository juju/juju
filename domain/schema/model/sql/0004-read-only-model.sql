-- The model table represents a readonly denormalised model data. The intended
-- use is to provide a read-only view of the model data for the purpose of
-- accessing common model data without the need to span multiple databases.
--
-- The model table primarily is used to drive the provider tracker. The model
-- table should *not* be changed in a patch/build release. The only time to make
-- changes to this table is during a major/minor release.
