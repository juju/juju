## Why Juju?

Juju increases your productivity and decreases your costs.

- **Increase confidence**  
 If you have ever put off upgrading something in production because something might break, then consider Juju.
 Juju allows applications to automatically negotiate their configuration, creating optimal settings dynamically.


- **Reduce complexity**  
 Microservices have made applications simpler, but operations more complex.
 Regain your understanding of the whole stack.


- **Strengthen operations knowledge**  
 Everyone has their in-house expert.
 Encapsulating their know-how in charms distributes that knowledge throughout the business.


- **Simplify day two and beyond**  
 Upgrades, provisioning new capacity, applying configuration changes can be subtle and difficult.
 Juju takes responsibility for them, as well as deployment.


 - **Maintain portability and repeatability**  
 Retain control over your deployment and eliminate the need for vendor-specific offerings.
 Your devops tooling should be cloud-agnostic and Kubernetes-aware.
