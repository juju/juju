# Exercising the CMR Juju functionality which allows applications to
# communicate between different models.
# This test will exercise the following aspects:
#  - Ensure a user is able to create an offer of an application's endpoint
#    including:
#      - A user is able to consume and relate to the offer
#      - Workload data successfully provided
#      - The offer appears in the list-offers output
#      - The user is able to name the offer
#      - The user is able to remove the offer
#  - Ensure an admin can grant a user access to an offer
#      - The consuming user finds the offer via 'find-offer'
#
# The above feature tests will be run on:
#  - A single controller environment
