# Test Suite

The following package contains the integration test suite for Juju.

Tests are structured into test suites. Each suite contains a root task (akin
to a package test) that will setup and run each individual test.

To help break tests down, each test can have a number of subtests. Subtests
are meant for individual units of work, without having to bootstrap a controller
for every test. Each subtest will just `ensure` that it does have one; failing
to find a suitable controller, it will create one for you.

### Example of a test suite

```sh
/suites/deploy/                    # test-suite
               task.sh             # root/package test (setup)
               deploy_bundles.sh   # tests
```

### Example of a test

```sh
run_deploy_bundles() {             # Subtest

}

test_deploy_bundles() {            # Test
    run "run_deploy_bundles"       # Run subtest
}
```

## Exit codes / Success

All tests will run through until the end of a test/subtest, unless it encounters
a non-zero exit code. In other words, if you want to assert something passes,
ensure that the command returns `exit 0`. Failure can then be detected of the
inverse.

```sh
echo "passes" | grep -q "passes"   # passes
echo "failed" | grep -q "passes"   # fails
```

## Getting started

Before running tests, you'll need to install `shellcheck` and `golangci-lint`:

```sh
sudo snap install shellcheck
go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@v1.44.2
```

To get started, it's best to quickly look at the help command from the runner.

```sh
cd tests && ./main.sh -h
```

Running a full sweep of the integration tests (which will take a long time), can
be done by running:

```sh
cd tests && ./main.sh -A
```

### Running tests

To run the tests, they can be broken down into steps:

```sh
./main.sh deploy                     # Runs deploy test suite
./main.sh deploy test_deploy_bundles # Runs test (and all of the subtests)
./main.sh deploy run_deploy_bundle   # Runs subtest
```

Note: running subtests, will also invoke the parent test to ensure that it has
everything setup correctly.

Running `./main.sh deploy run_deploy_bundle` will also run `test_deploy_bundles`,
but no other subtests, just `run_deploy_bundle`.

### Using local controllers

The use of local controllers whilst development is advantagous because you don't
have to rebootstrap a controller, or you can test a particular setup that has
been manually created.

To do so, just specify a controller name and pass it though.

```sh
./main.sh -l <local-controller-name> deploy
```

Note: because you're using a local controller, you don't get the same guarantees
of setup and cleanup that you can with letting the test suite do that for you.
So if you expect everything to be cleaned up and leave no trace, then don't use
this method of bootstrapping.
