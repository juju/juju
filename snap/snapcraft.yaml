summary: Juju - a model-driven operator lifecycle manager for K8s and machines
description: |
  A model-driven **universal operator lifecycle manager** for multi cloud and hybrid cloud application management on K8s and machines.

  **What is an operator lifecycle manager?**
  Kubernetes operators are containers with operations code, that drive your applications on K8s. Juju is an operator lifecycle manager that manages the installation, integration and configuration of operators on the cluster. Juju also extends the idea of operators to traditional application management on Linux and Windows servers, or cloud instances.

  **Model-driven operations and integration**
  Organise your operators into models, which group together applications that can be tightly integrated on the same substrate and operated by the same team. Capture resource allocation, storage, networking and integration information in the model to simplify ongoing operations.

  **Better day-2 operations**
  Each operator code package, called a charm, declares methods for actions like back, restore, or security audit. Calling these methods provides remote administration of the application with no low-level access required.
