This document is about our releases of Juju, that is, the `juju` CLI client and the Juju agents.

- We release new minor version (the 'x' of m.x.p) approximately every 3 months.
- Patch releases for supported series are released every month
- Once we release a new major version, the latest minor version of the previous release will become an LTS (Long Term Support) release.
- Minor releases are supported with bug fixes for a period of 4 months from their release date, and a further 2 months of security fixes. LTS releases will receive security fixes for 12 years.
- 4.0 is an exception to the rule, as it is still under development. We plan on releasing beta versions that are content driven and not time.

The rest of this document gives detailed information about each release.
