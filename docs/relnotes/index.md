These are the notes of Juju releases, that is, the `juju` CLI client and the Juju agents.

- We release new minor version (the 'x' of m.x.p) approximately every 3 months.
- Patch releases for supported series are released every month
- Once we release a new major version, the latest minor version of the previous release will become an LTS (Long Term Support) release.
- Minor releases are supported with bug fixes for a period of 4 months from their release date, and a further 2 months of security fixes. LTS releases will receive security fixes for 12 years.
