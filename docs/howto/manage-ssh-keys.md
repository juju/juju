## Add an SSH key

To add a public `ssh` key to a model, use the `add-ssh-key` command followed by a string containing the entire key or an equivalent shell formula:

```text

# Use the entire ssh key:
juju add-ssh-key "ssh-rsa qYfS5LieM79HIOr535ret6xy

# Use an equivalent shell formula:
juju add-ssh-key "$(cat ~/mykey.pub)"

```

<!--SAW THIS SOMEWHERE ELSE. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DEFAULT USER FOR A JUJU MACHINE. BUT WHICH JUJU MACHINE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT NOW? WE JUST SAID WE'RE ADDING THIS TO THE MODEL.

This will add the SSH key to the default user account named 'ubuntu'.

## Import an SSH key

To import a public SSH key from Launchpad / Github to a model, use the `import-ssh-key` command followed by `lp:` / `gh:` and the name of the user account. For example, the code below imports all the public keys associated with the Github user account ‘phamilton’:

```text
juju import-ssh-key gh:phamilton
```

<!--SAW THIS SOMEWHERE ELSE. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE DEFAULT USER FOR A JUJU MACHINE. BUT WHICH JUJU MACHINE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT NOW? WE JUST SAID WE'RE ADDING THIS TO THE MODEL.

This will add the SSH key to the default user account named 'ubuntu'.

## View the available SSH keys

To list the SSH keys known in the current model, use the `ssh-keys` command.

```text
juju ssh-keys
```

If you want to get more details, or get this information for a different model, use the `--full` or the `--model / -m <model name>` option.

<!--# List the keys known in the 'jujutest' model
juju ssh-keys -m jujutest --full
-->

## Remove an SSH key

To remove an SSH key, use the `remove-ssh-key` command followed by the key / a space-separated list of keys. The keys may be specified by either their fingerprint or the text label associated with them. The example below illustrates both:

```text
juju remove-ssh-key 45:7f:33:2c:10:4e:6c:14:e3:a1:a4:c8:b2:e1:34:b4 bob@ubuntu
```
