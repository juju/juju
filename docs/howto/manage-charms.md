# How to manage charms or bundles

> See also: {ref}`charm`

This document shows various ways in which you may interact with a charm or a bundle.

(build-a-charm)=
## Build a charm

See [Charmcraft docs](https://canonical-charmcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/) for how to initialize, pack, and publish a charm on Charmhub.


See [Ops docs](https://ops.readthedocs.io/) for how to develop and test a charm.

<!--
> See more: {ref}`charming-history`
-->

```{tip}
For certain types of applications (Django, FastAPI, Flask, and Go), Charmcraft also takes care of all the code for you, provided you use the relevant Charmcraft extension.
```

## Query Charmhub for available charms / bundles


To query Charmhub for the charms / bundles that deliver a given application, run the `find` command followed by a suitable keyword. For example, to find out the charms and/or bundles that deliver WordPress:

```text
juju find wordpress
```


> See more: {ref}`command-juju-find`


## View details about a Charmhub charm / bundle


To view details about a particular Charmhub charm / bundle, run the `info` command followed by the name of the charm / bundle. For example:

```text
juju info postgresql
```
> See more: {ref}`command-juju-info`

```{caution}

For comprehensive information about the charm, including charm documentation, it is always best to see the charm's page on Charmhub.

```

## Find out the resources available for a charm

> See more: {ref}`manage-charm-resources`


## Download a Charmhub charm

```{important}

This is relevant for air-gapped deployments.

```

To download a Charmhub charm, run the `download` command followed by the name of the charm. For example:

```text
juju download postgresql
```

> See more: {ref}`command-juju-download`


(deploy-a-charm)=
## Deploy a charm / bundle


To deploy a charm / bundle from [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/) / your local filesystem, use the `deploy` command followed by the name of the charm / bundle / the path to the local `<charm>.charm` / `<bundle>.yaml` file:


``` text
juju deploy <charm | charm bundle> | <path to the local charm or bundle>
```

````{dropdown} Example: Deploy a Charmhub charm

```text
juju deploy mysql
```

````



````{dropdown} Example: Deploy a Charmhub bundle

```{tip}

To get a summary of the deployment steps (without actually deploying), add the `--dry-run` flag. Note: This flag is only supported for bundles, not charms.

```

```text
juju deploy kubeflow
```

````

````{dropdown} Example: Deploy a local charm


```text
juju deploy ./mini_ubuntu-20.04-amd64.charm
```

````


````{dropdown} Example: Deploy a local charm with a resource


If your charm's `metadata.yaml` specifies a {ref}`resource <charm-resource>`, you must also explicitly pass the resource. For example:

```text
juju deploy ./demo-api-charm_ubuntu-22.04-amd64.charm --resource \
     demo-server-image=ghcr.io/beliaev-maksim/api_demo_server:0.0.9
```

````

````{dropdown} Example: Deploy a local bundle

```text
juju deploy ./mediawiki-model-bundle.yaml
```

````

`````{dropdown} Example: Deploy a local bundle as an overlay


To deploy a local bundle as an overlay, run the `deploy` command with the `--overlay` flag followed by the path to the overlay. To add an overlay to a model later, export the contents of the model to a bundle and deploy that bundle with the overlay.

````{dropdown} Generic example:

Suppose you want to deploy `mediawiki` and also apply an overlay bundle called `custom-wikimedia.yaml`. Run the `deploy` command followed by `mediawiki` and the `--overlay` flag followed by the local path to your overlay bundle `yaml`:

```text
juju deploy mediawiki \
  --overlay ./custom-mediawiki.yaml
```

Suppose now that have a model where you've already deployed `mediawiki`. You've also made some other changes in your model. Finally, you'd like to apply an overlay bundle `custom-mediawiki.yaml`. In that case:

1. Export the contents of your model to a bundle (below, `mediawiki-bundle.yaml`):

```text
juju export-bundle --filename mediawiki-model-bundle.yaml
```

2. Deploy the new bundle and during deploy apply the overlay:

```text
juju deploy ./mediawiki-model-bundle.yaml \
  --overlay ./custom-mediawiki.yaml
```


````

````{dropdown} OpenStack example


Suppose you want to deploy an OpenStack cloud. This is done by deploying a base bundle defining the cloud with an overlay bundle, to make the bundle deployable within the local environment, and -- optionally -- any other number of bundles, to override / add parameters in / to the existing bundle, e.g., storage or constraints. Run the `deploy` command followed by the base bundle and then repeat the `--overlay` flag followed by the path to the overlay for as many overlays as you want. For example, below we deploy an OpenStack Yoga cloud running on Focal nodes (our base bundle), ensure it can run in a MAAS environment (the first, mandatory, overlay) and that it has Shared filesystem services (the second overlay):

``` text
juju deploy ./bundle-focal-yoga.yaml \
   --overlay ./overlay-focal-yoga-mymaas.yaml
   --overlay ./overlay-focal-yoga-mymaas-shared-filesystem.yaml
```

Suppose now that have a model where you've already deployed all of the above. You've maybe also made some other changes in your model. And you'd like to add manual zone Swift services by applying another overlay.

1. Export the contents of your model to a bundle (below, `exported-bundle-focal-yoga-2022-06-07.yaml`):

``` text
juju export-bundle --filename exported-bundle-focal-yoga-2022-06-07.yaml
```

2. Deploy the new bundle and during deploy apply the overlay:

``` text
juju deploy ./exported-bundle-focal-yoga-2022-06-07.yaml \
   --overlay ./overlay-focal-yoga-mymaas-manual-swift.yaml
```

````
`````

````{dropdown} Example: Deploy a bundle to existing machines

To have a bundle use a model's existing machines, as opposed to creating new machines, the `--map-machines=existing` option is used. In addition, to specify particular machines for the mapping, comma-separated values of the form 'bundle-id=existing-id' can be passed where the bundle-id and the existing-id refer to top level machine IDs.

For example, consider a bundle whose YAML file is configured with machines 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a model containing machines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The following deployment would use existing machines 1 and 2 for bundle machines 1 and 2 but use existing machine 4 for bundle machine 3 and existing machine 5 for bundle machine 4:

```text
juju deploy some-bundle --map-machines=existing,3=4,4=5
```

````

Depending on the cloud substrate that your controller is running on, the above command will allocate a machine (physical,  virtual, LXD container) or a Kubernetes pod and then proceed to deploy the contents of the charm / bundle.

```{note}

Depending on your use case, you may alternatively opt to provision a set of machines in advance via the `juju add-machine` command.

In this case, when running the above `juju deploy` command, Juju will detect that the model contains machines with no applications assigned to them and automatically deploy the application to one of those machines instead of spinning up a new machine.

```

The command also allows you to add another argument to specify a custom name (alias) for your deployed application (charms only). You can also take advantage of the rich set of flags to specify a charm channel or revision, a machine base, a machine constraint (e.g., availability zone), the number of application units you want (clusterised), a space binding, a placement directive (e.g., to deploy to a LXD container), a specific storage instance, a specific machine, etc., and even to trust the application with the current credential -- in case the application requires access to the backing cloud in order to fulfil its purpose (e.g., stojrage-related tasks).

```{note}

When deploying, if Juju fails to provision a subset of machines for some reason (e.g. machine quota limits on the cloud provider) the command {ref}`command-juju-retry-provisioning` can be used to retry the provisioning of specific machine numbers.

```

````{dropdown} Examples: Use a placement directive to deploy to specific targets

> See also: {ref}`placement-directive`

```text
# Deploy to a new lxd-type container on new machine:
juju deploy mariadb --to lxd

# Deploy to a new container on existing machine 25:
juju deploy mongodb --to lxd:25

# Deploy to existing lxd-type container 3 on existing machine 24:
juju deploy nginx --to 24/lxd/3

# Deploy to zone us-east-1a on AWS:
juju deploy mysql --to zone=us-east-1a

# Deploy to a specific machine on MAAS:
juju deploy mediawiki --to node1.maas

# Deploy to a specific machine on LXD:
juju deploy mariadb --to node1.lxd

```

For a Kubernetes-backed cloud, a Kubernetes node can be targeted based on matching labels. The label can be either built-in or one that is user-defined and added to the node. For example:

```text
# Deploy to a specific Kubernetes node (using either a built-in or a user-defined label):
juju deploy mariadb-k8s --to kubernetes.io/hostname=somehost

```

(debug-a-charm)=
## Debug a charm

To debug a charm:

- Carefully review `juju status` (if there are relations: `juju status --relations`). If a charm is in `blocked` state, there might be a message about steps to unblock.

> See more: {ref}`command-juju-status`

- Examine the Juju agent and the charm logs.

> See more: {ref}`manage-logs`

- Take a closer look at the application and its units.

> See more: {ref}`view-details-about-an-application`, {ref}`view-details-about-a-unit`

- For a Kubernetes charm with a workload, {ref}`command-juju-ssh` into the workload container and view the Pebble plan.

````{dropdown} Tips and examples

(debug-a-k8s-charm-with-a-workload)=

```text
juju ssh --container=concourse-worker concourse-worker/0
```
This will drop you into an ssh session in the workload container (`concourse-worker`) of this unit (`concourse-worker/0`). Here you can interact with the `pebble` process running in your workload container. Note that `pebble` is not in `PATH`, so you need to use the full path to the executable, like so:
```text
/charm/bin/pebble plan
```
Which, in this example, produces the following output:
```text
services:
    concourse-worker:
        summary: concourse worker node
        startup: enabled
        override: replace
        command: /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh worker
        environment:
            CONCOURSE_BAGGAGECLAIM_DRIVER: overlay
            CONCOURSE_TSA_HOST: 10.1.234.43:2222
            CONCOURSE_TSA_PUBLIC_KEY: /concourse-keys/tsa_host_key.pub
            CONCOURSE_TSA_WORKER_PRIVATE_KEY: /concourse-keys/worker_key
            CONCOURSE_WORK_DIR: /opt/concourse/worker
```

In some cases, your workload container might not allow you to run things in it, if, for instance, it’s based on a “scratch” image. To get around this, you can ssh into the charm container instead, and interact with the `pebble` instance in the workload container from there, just like the charm code does. To ssh into the charm container, drop the `--container=...` option or specify the `charm` container.
```text
juju ssh concourse-worker/0
```
```text
juju --container=charm concourse-worker/0
```
The command to run in the charm container is the same, but with the `PEBBLE_SOCKET` envronment variable set, and will produce the same output.
```text
PEBBLE_SOCKET=/charm/containers/concourse-worker/pebble.socket /charm/bin/pebble plan
```
An interactive session can be helpful for further debugging, but you can also specify the full command in the `juju ssh` invocation.
```text
juju ssh concourse-worker/0 PEBBLE_SOCKET=/charm/containers/concourse-worker/pebble.socket /charm/bin/pebble plan
```
This is a bit of a mouthful, but if you're a [jhack](https://github.com/canonical/jhack) user then there's the `jhack pebble` command which takes care of the socket and Pebble paths for you.
```text
jhack pebble --container=concourse-worker concourse-worker/0 plan
```

- If the charm is involved in a relation, take a look at the relation data.

```text
$ juju exec --unit your-charm/0 "relation-ids foo"
foo:123
$  juju exec --unit your-charm/0 "relation-list -r bar:foo"
other-charm/0
$ juju exec --unit nova-compute/0 "relation-get -r foo:30 - other-charm/0"
hostname: 1.2.3.4
password: passw0rd
private-address: 2.3.45.
somekey: somedata
```

- Debug a single failing hook:

```text
juju debug-hooks mysql/0                     # for any hook
juju debug-hooks mysql/0 X-relation-changed  # for a specific hook
```

The command launches a tmux session that will intercept matching hooks and/or
actions, which you can then execute manually by running `./dispatch`.

> See more: {ref}`command-juju-debug-hooks`

`````{dropdown} Tips
A debugging session lands you in `/var/lib/juju`, and as soon as a hook fires, the tmux session automatically takes you to `/var/lib/juju/agents/unit-mysql-0/charm`.

There, you need to execute hook manually. This means running `./dispatch`, which launches your charm code with the current hook's context.

You can run `./dispatch` multiple times, modifying your charm code in between, as your investigation progresses. You could:

- directly edit src/charm.py in the tmux session; or
- manually sync with `juju scp` or `rsync`; or
- automatically sync with `jhack sync`; etc.

Moreover, if you (temporarily) include `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` anywhere in your code, then you’ll be placed in a `pdb` session whenever `./dispatch` encounters a `set_trace()` statement.

For example:

1. Run `juju debug-hooks mysql/0 X-relation-joined`.
1. Create the integration (`juju integrate` ...).
1. Wait for the `debug-hooks` session to start.
1. Start a `jhack sync` session including whatever file is surfacing the error:
    1. `cd` into the charm root folder on your local filesystem.
    1. If the code raising the exception is in `/lib` or `/src`, you don’t have to do anything special. If not, check the documentation for `jhack sync` to see how you can include the file.
    1. Run `jhack sync <name of broken unit>`. <br> This will start listening for changes in your local tree and push them to the unit. Whatever edits you make locally will be ssh’d into the live running unit.
1. Write wherever you like: `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` and save (so that `jhack` will sync the change).
1. In the `debug-hooks` shell, type `./dispatch` (a small shell script located in the charm folder on the unit that executes the charm code).
1. Welcome to `pdb`.

This recipe is interesting because it allows you to run the same event handler over and over while making changes to the code. You can run `./dispatch`, debug at will, exit the debugger. Remove the `pdb` call, try dispatching again. Once, twice… Is the bug gone? Very well, you’re done. Not gone? Rinse and repeat.

````{dropdown} Example: Debug a tracing relation in a testing environment

```text
# in shell A
$ juju debug-hooks tester/0 tracing-relation-joined

# in shell B
$ jhack nuke tester:tracing
$ juju relate tester tempo

# in shell A
[...]
./dispatch
tmux kill-session -t tester/0 # or, equivalently, CTRL+a d
# CTRL+a is tmux prefix.

root@tester-0:/var/lib/juju/agents/unit-tester-0/charm#


# in shell B
$ cd /path/to/tester/charm/root
$ jhack sync tester/0

$ vim ./src/charm.py
[...]
# insert at some line:
#import pdb; pdb.set_trace(header="hello debugger-world")
```

At this point you're all set. If you save the file, `jhack sync` will push it to `tester/0`. That means that if you dispatch the event, you will execute the code you just changed.

```bash
# in shell A:
$ ./dispatch
hello debugger-world
> /var/lib/juju/agents/unit-tester-0/charm/src/charm.py(34)__init__()
-> self.container: Container = self.unit.get_container(self._container_name)
(Pdb) self
<__main__.TempoTesterCharm object at 0x7f3af724e370>
(Pdb)
```

`````

- (For charms built with Ops and equipped with [`pdb`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) breakpoints:) Step into a live debugger:

```text
juju debug-code --at=hook <unit>
```

> See more: {ref}`command-juju-debug-code`

- Debug a flow: Use [`jhack`](https://snapcraft.io/jhack) (esp. [`jhack sync`](https://github.com/canonical/jhack#sync)), {manpage}`rsync(1)`, {ref}`command-juju-ssh`.


`````{dropdown} Tips
1. Start a `jhack sync` session on the charm root (see note in recipe 1).
1. `jhack fire` the event you wish to debug or work on the unit you're syncing to.
1. Look at the logging or the resulting state (charm status, app data, workload config, etc...).

What is good about this flow is that:

1. You're not forced to wait for an event to occur "for real" in order to execute the handler for it.
1. You can easily test several handlers in succession by firing different events. For example, `relation-created`, `relation-changed` ...

What is risky about this flow is that the context that the event normally occurs in is not granted to be there. If you `jhack fire X-relation-created` while in fact there is no relation X, your charm might make some bad assumptions (which is why you should always write your charm code making basically no assumptions).

````{dropdown} Example: Debug a tracing relation in a testing environment

Working with the same example as in the case where we were trying to debug a single failing hook above, the commands would be:

```text
# in shell A
$ cd /path/to/tester/charm/root
$ jhack sync tester/0

# in shell B
jhack fire tester/0 tracing-relation-changed
```

That's it. In your editor you can locally make any change you like to the tester source, and when you're done you can manually trigger the event.

(update-a-charm)=
## Update a charm

Updating a charm to the latest revision always involves the `refresh` command, but the exact way to use it differs a little bit depending on whether you are dealing with a Charmhub charm or rather a local charm.


### Update a Charmhub charm

```{important}

Because of the way charm channels work, 'updating' doesn't have to mean 'upgrading' -- you can switch to any charm revision, no matter if it's newer or older. The instructions below reflect this.

However, as newer versions typically contain improvements, Juju will notify you if a new version exists: Juju polls Charmhub once a day to check for updates and, if an update is found, the poll will cause `juju status` to indicate that a newer charm version is available.

```


1. **If you don't know your current channel:** Run `status` and check the App > Channel column.

1. **If you don't know which channel you want to update to / would like to find out all the available channels:** Run `info` followed by the charm name.

1. Run `refresh` followed by the charm name and the desired new `channel`.

### Update a local charm

To update a local charm, run the `refresh` command followed by the name of the charm and the local path to the charm:


```text
juju refresh juju-test --path ./path/to/juju-test
```

The command offers many other options, for example, the possibility to replace a charm completely with another charm by using the `--switch` option followed by a different path (a process known as 'crossgrading'). (Note: `--path` and `--switch` are mutually exclusive. Use `--switch` if you want to replace your existing charm with  a completely new charm.)

## Remove a charm / bundle

As a charm / bundle is just the *means* by which (an) application(s) are deployed, there is no way to remove the *charm* / *bundle*. What you *can* do, however, is remove the *application* / *model*.
