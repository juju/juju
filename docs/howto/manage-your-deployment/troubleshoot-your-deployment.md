# How to troubleshoot your deployment

From the point of view of the user, there are four basic failure scenarios:

1. Command that fails to return – things hang at some step (e.g., `bootstrap` or `deploy`) and eventually timeout with an error.
1. Command that returns an error.
1. Command that returns but, immediately after, `juju status` shows errors.
1. Things look fine but, at some later point, `juju status` shows errors.

In all cases you'll want to understand what's causing the error so you can figure out the way out:

- For (1)-(3) you can check the documentation for the specific procedure you were trying to perform right before the error -- you might find a troubleshooting box with the exact error message, what it means, and how you can solve the issue.

> - The troubleshooting box at the end of {ref}`migrate-a-model`
> - ...

- For (1)-(2) you can also retry the command with the global flags `--debug` and `--verbose` (best used together; for `bootstrap`, also use `--keep-broken` -- if a machine is provisioned, this will ensure that it is not destroyed upon bootstrap fail, which will enable you to examine the logs). 
- For all of (1)-(4), you can examine the logs by 
    - running `juju debug-log` (best used with `--tail`, because some errors are transient so the last lines tend to be the most relevant; also with  `–level=ERROR` and, if the point of failure is known, `–include ...` as well, to filter the output) or 
    - examining the log files directly.

- For (3)-(4) the error might also be coming from a particular hook or action. In that case, use `juju debug-hooks` to launch a tmux session that will intercept matching hooks and/or actions. Then you can fix the error by manually configuring the workload, or editing the charm code. Once it is fixed you can run `juju resolved` to inform the charm that you have fixed the issue and it can continue.
