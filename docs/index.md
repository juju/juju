Juju is an open source orchestration engine for software operators that enables the deployment, integration, and lifecycle management of applications in the cloud using special software operators called ‘charms’.

Juju and charms provide a simple, consistent, and repeatable way to install, provision, maintain, update, upgrade, and integrate applications on and across Kubernetes containers, Linux containers, virtual machines, and bare metal machines, on public or private cloud.

Application- and cloud-specific challenges can make operations complex, especially with sophisticated workloads in hybrid environments. Juju and charms abstract away that complexity, making all clouds and operations feel the same -- at any scale, on any cloud.

Whether you are a CIO or SysAdmin, DevOps engineer, or SRE, Juju helps you take control.
