Juju is an open source orchestration engine for software operators that enables the deployment, integration and lifecycle management of applications at any scale, on any infrastructure, using special software operators called ‘charms’.

Juju provides a model-driven way to install, provision, maintain, update, upgrade, and integrate applications on and across Kubernetes containers, Linux containers, virtual machines, and bare metal machines, on public or private cloud.

As such, Juju makes it simple, intuitive, and efficient to manage the full lifecycle of complex applications in hybrid cloud.

For system operators and DevOps who manage applications in the cloud, Juju simplifies code; for CIOs, it helps align code with business decisions.
