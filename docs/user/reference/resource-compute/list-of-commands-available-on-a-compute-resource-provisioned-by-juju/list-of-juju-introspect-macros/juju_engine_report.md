# `juju_engine_report`

The engine report is a window into the internals of the agent. This is primarily useful to developers to help debug problems that may be occurring in deployed systems.

In order to manage complexity in the juju agents, there are *workers* that have very distinct and limited purpose. Workers can have dependencies on other workers. The [dependency engine](https://godoc.org/gopkg.in/juju/worker.v1/dependency) is the entity that runs the workers and deals with those dependencies. The `juju_engine_report` is the current view into the dependency engine running the agent's workers.

## Usage
Can be run on any juju machine, expected state is different for controller machines, ha, and machines running workloads.
```code
juju_engine_report
```

## Example output

## Interesting Output

* Dependencies with a larger `start_count` than others. This can indicate that the worker is bouncing.

* Dependencies that are stopped when they should be started. Perhaps the `inputs` are not starting.

* Dependencies that are started which should be stopped. Can prevent a unit from upgrading or migrating if the workers do not quiesce.

* A controllers engine report will contain the model cache contents as of 2.9

* The report from an individual unit contains the local-state and relation, formerly in a file on the unit:
