**When Juju 4.0 is released, if you upgrade your `juju` client to 4+:** That will introduce a change that will break the `python-libjuju` client. This issue will be addressed in an upcoming `python-libjuju` release. Stay tuned and make sure to update!  See more: [Discourse | Juju 4.0 AllWatcher API changes](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/juju-4-0-allwatcher-api-changes/14614).

`python-libjuju` is one of the {ref}`client <client>` libraries of Juju that allows interaction with a Juju controller via Python scripts.

Install it on your Python setup (e.g. `pip install juju`), and you have the full control of your infrastructure that you can control via your scripts. `python-libjuju` often proves to be very useful in automated testing, as well as quick interactions with Juju entities using just the Python REPL.
