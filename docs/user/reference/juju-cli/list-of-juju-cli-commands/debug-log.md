Include only messages from the mysql/0 unit; show a maximum of 50 lines; and then
exit:

    juju debug-log --include mysql/0 --limit 50

Show all messages from the apache/2 unit or machine 1 and then exit:

    juju debug-log --replay --include apache/2 --include machine-1 --no-tail

Show all juju.worker.uniter logging module messages that are also unit
wordpress/0 messages, and then show any new log messages which match the
filter and append:

    juju debug-log --replay
        --include-module juju.worker.uniter \
        --include wordpress/0

Show all messages from the juju.worker.uniter module, except those sent from

    juju debug-log --replay --no-tail
        --include-module juju.worker.uniter \
        --exclude machine-3 \

## Details

This command provides access to all logged Juju activity on a per-model
basis. By default, the logs for the currently select model are shown.

Each log line is emitted in this format:

  &lt;entity&gt; &lt;timestamp&gt; &lt;log-level&gt; &lt;module&gt;:&lt;line-no&gt; &lt;message&gt;

The "entity" is the source of the message: a machine or unit. The names for
machines and units can be seen in the output of `juju status`.

The '--include' and '--exclude' options filter by entity. The entity can be
a machine, unit, or application for vm models, but can be application only
for k8s models. These filters support wildcards `*` if filtering on the
entity full name (prefixed by `<entity type>-`)

The '--include-module' and '--exclude-module' options filter by (dotted)
logging module name. The module name can be truncated such that all loggers
with the prefix will match.

The '--include-label' and '--exclude-label' options filter by logging label. 

The filtering options combine as follows:
* All --include options are logically ORed together.
* All --exclude options are logically ORed together.
* All --include-module options are logically ORed together.
* All --exclude-module options are logically ORed together.
* All --include-label options are logically ORed together.
* All --exclude-label options are logically ORed together.
* The combined --include, --exclude, --include-module, --exclude-module,
  --include-label and --exclude-label selections are logically ANDed to form
  the complete filter.
