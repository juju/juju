## Details
Used without arguments, bootstrap will step you through the process of
initializing a Juju cloud environment. Initialization consists of creating
a 'controller' model and provisioning a machine to act as controller.

Controller names may only contain lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, and
may not start with a hyphen.
We recommend you call your controller ‘username-region’ e.g. ‘fred-us-east-1’.
See --clouds for a list of clouds and credentials.
See --regions &lt;cloud&gt; for a list of available regions for a given cloud.

Credentials are set beforehand and are distinct from any other
configuration (see `juju add-credential`).
The 'controller' model typically does not run workloads. It should remain
pristine to run and manage Juju's own infrastructure for the corresponding
cloud. Additional models should be created with `juju add-model` for workload purposes.
Note that a 'default' model is also created and becomes the current model
of the environment once the command completes. It can be discarded if
other models are created.

If '--bootstrap-constraints' is used, its values will also apply to any
future controllers provisioned for high availability (HA).

If '--constraints' is used, its values will be set as the default
constraints for all future workload machines in the model, exactly as if
the constraints were set with `juju set-model-constraints`.

It is possible to override constraints and the automatic machine selection
algorithm by assigning a "placement directive" via the '--to' option. This
dictates what machine to use for the controller. This would typically be
used with the MAAS provider ('--to &lt;host&gt;.maas').

You can change the default timeout and retry delays used during the
bootstrap by changing the following settings in your configuration
(all values represent number of seconds):

    # How long to wait for a connection to the controller
    bootstrap-timeout: 1200  # default: 20 minutes
    # How long to wait between connection attempts to a controller address.
    bootstrap-retry-delay: 5  # default: 5 seconds
    # How often to refresh controller addresses from the API server.
    bootstrap-addresses-delay: 10  # default: 10 seconds

It is possible to override the base e.g. ubuntu@22.04, Juju attempts 
to bootstrap on to, by supplying a base argument to '--bootstrap-base'.

An error is emitted if the determined base is not supported. Using the
'--force' option to override this check:

    juju bootstrap --bootstrap-base=ubuntu@22.04 --force

The '--bootstrap-series' flag can be still used, but is deprecated in favour
of '--bootstrap-base'.

Private clouds may need to specify their own custom image metadata and
tools/agent. Use '--metadata-source' whose value is a local directory.

By default, the Juju version of the agent binary that is downloaded and
installed on all models for the new controller will be the same as that
of the Juju client used to perform the bootstrap.
However, a user can specify a different agent version via '--agent-version'
option to bootstrap command. Juju will use this version for models' agents
as long as the client's version is from the same Juju release base.
In other words, a 2.2.1 client can bootstrap any 2.2.x agents but cannot
bootstrap any 2.0.x or 2.1.x agents.
The agent version can be specified a simple numeric version, e.g. 2.2.4.

For example, at the time when 2.3.0, 2.3.1 and 2.3.2 are released and your
agent stream is 'released' (default), then a 2.3.1 client can bootstrap:
   * 2.3.0 controller by running '... bootstrap --agent-version=2.3.0 ...';
   * 2.3.1 controller by running '... bootstrap ...';
   * 2.3.2 controller by running 'bootstrap --auto-upgrade'.
However, if this client has a copy of codebase, then a local copy of Juju
will be built and bootstrapped - 2.3.1.1.

Bootstrapping to a k8s cluster requires that the service set up to handle
requests to the controller be accessible outside the cluster. Typically this
means a service type of LoadBalancer is needed, and Juju does create such a
service if it knows it is supported by the cluster. This is performed by
interrogating the cluster for a well known managed deployment such as microk8s,
GKE or EKS.

When bootstrapping to a k8s cluster Juju does not recognise, there's no
guarantee a load balancer is available, so Juju defaults to a controller
service type of ClusterIP. This may not be suitable, so there are three bootstrap
options available to tell Juju how to set up the controller service. Part of
the solution may require a load balancer for the cluster to be set up manually
first, or perhaps an external k8s service via a FQDN will be used
(this is a cluster specific implementation decision which Juju needs to be
informed about so it can set things up correctly). The three relevant bootstrap
options are (see list of bootstrap config items below for a full explanation):

- controller-service-type
- controller-external-name
- controller-external-ips

Juju advertises those addresses to other controllers, so they must be resolveable from
other controllers for cross-model (cross-controller, actually) relations to work.

If a storage pool is specified using --storage-pool, this will be created
in the controller model.
