## Examples

Set the base for the ubuntu application to ubuntu@20.04:

	juju set-application-base ubuntu ubuntu@20.04


## Details

The specified application's base value will be set within juju. Any subordinates 
of the application will also have their base set to the provided value. A base 
can be specified using the OS name and the version of the OS, separated by @.

This will not change the base of any existing units, rather new units will use
the new base when deployed.

It is recommended to only do this after upgrade-machine has been run for 
machine containing all existing units of the application.

To ensure correct binaries, run 'juju refresh' before running 'juju add-unit'.
