## Summary
Adds a credential for a cloud to a local client and uploads it to a controller.

## Usage
```juju add-credential [options] <cloud name>```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `-c`, `--controller` |  | Controller to operate in |
| `--client` | false | Client operation |
| `-f`, `--file` |  | The YAML file containing credentials to add |
| `--region` |  | Cloud region that credential is valid for |

## Examples

    juju add-credential google
    juju add-credential google --client
    juju add-credential google -c mycontroller
    juju add-credential aws -f ~/credentials.yaml -c mycontroller
    juju add-credential aws -f ~/credentials.yaml
    juju add-credential aws -f ~/credentials.yaml --client


## Details

The juju add-credential command operates in two modes.

When called with only the &lt;cloud name&gt; argument, `juju add-credential` will 
take you through an interactive prompt to add a credential specific to 
the cloud provider.

Providing the `-f <credentials.yaml>` option switches to the 
non-interactive mode. &lt;credentials.yaml&gt; must be a path to a correctly 
formatted YAML-formatted file. 

Sample yaml file shows five credentials being stored against four clouds:

    credentials:
      aws:
        <credential-name>:
          auth-type: access-key
          access-key: <key>
          secret-key: <key>
      azure:
        <credential-name>:
          auth-type: service-principal-secret
          application-id: <uuid>
          application-password: <password>
          subscription-id: <uuid>
      lxd:
        <credential-a>:
          auth-type: interactive
          trust-password: <password>
        <credential-b>:
          auth-type: interactive
          trust-password: <password>
      google:
        <credential-name>:
          auth-type: oauth2
          project-id: <project-id>
          private-key: <private-key>
          client-email: <email>
          client-id: <client-id>

The &lt;credential-name&gt; parameter of each credential is arbitrary, but must
be unique within each &lt;cloud-name&gt;. This allows each cloud to store 
multiple credentials.

The format for a credential is cloud-specific. Thus, it's best to use
'add-credential' command in an interactive mode. This will result in
adding this new credential locally and / or uploading it to a controller 
in a correct format for the desired cloud.


Notes:
If you are setting up Juju for the first time, consider running
`juju autoload-credentials`. This may allow you to skip adding 
credentials manually.

This command does not set default regions nor default credentials for the
cloud. The commands `juju default-region` and `juju default-credential`
provide that functionality.

Use --controller option to upload a credential to a controller. 

Use --client option to add a credential to the current client.
