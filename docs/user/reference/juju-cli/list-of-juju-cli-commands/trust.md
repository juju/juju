### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `-m`, `--model` |  | Model to operate in. Accepts [&lt;controller name&gt;:]&lt;model name&gt;&#x7c;&lt;model UUID&gt; |

## Examples

    juju trust media-wiki

## Details
Sets the trust configuration value to true.

On k8s models, the trust operation currently grants the charm full access to the cluster.
Until the permissions model is refined to grant more granular role based access, the use of
'--scope=cluster' is required to confirm this choice.
