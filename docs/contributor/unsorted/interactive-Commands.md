# Interactive commands
**this page is a WIP and is subject to change**

Some commands in Juju are interactive. To keep the UX consistent across the product, please follow these guidelines.
Note, many of these guidelines are supported by the interact package at github.com/juju/juju/cmd/juju/interact.

* All interactive commands should begin with a short blurb telling the user that they've started an interactive wizard.
  `Starting interactive bootstrap process.`
* Prompts should be a short imperative sentence with the first letter capitalized, ending with a colon and a space
  before waiting for user input.
  `Enter your mother's maiden name: `
* Prompts should tell the user what to do, not ask them questions.  
  `Enter a name: ` rather than `What name do you want?`
* The only time a prompt should end with a question mark is for yes/no questions.
  `Use foobar as network? (Y/n): `
* Yes/no questions should always end with (y/n), with the default answer capitalized.
* Try to always format the question so you can make yes the default.
* Prompts that request the user choose from a list of options should start `Select a ...`
* Prompts that request the user enter text not from a list should start `Enter ....`
* Most prompts should have a reasonable default, shown in brackets just before the colon, which can be accepted by just
  hitting enter.
  `Select a cloud [localhost]: `
* Questions that have a list of answers should print out those options before the prompt.
* Options should be consistently sorted in a logical manner (usually alphabetical).
* Options should be a single short word, if possible.
* Selecting from a list of options should always be case insensitive.
* If an incorrect selection is entered, print a short error and reprint the prompt, but do not reprint the list of
  options. No blank line should be printed between the error and the corresponding prompt.
* Always print a blank line between prompts.
