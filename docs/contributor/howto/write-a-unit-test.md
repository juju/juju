This document demonstrates how to write a unit test for Juju.

### Create

`

In the code directory, for each file that you want to test (say, a source code file called `magic1.go`), create a
`<code-filename>_test.go`  (e.g. `magic1_test.go`).

## Import `tc`
> See also:  `tc` is based on [`gocheck`]( https://labix.org/gocheck)

In `magic1_test.go`, import the `tc` package:

```go
import (
"github.com/juju/tc"
)
```

### Add a unit test suite

> See also: {ref}`unit-test-suite`

Also in `magic1_test.go`, add a unit test suite.

> See more: {ref}`create-a-unit-test-suite`

Once the test suite structure has been created, we need to run it with `tc.Run`, you can do this by creating a `Test`
function that will be the entry-point into our test suite.

```go
type magicSuite struct{}

func TestMagicSuite(t *testing.T) {
  tc.Run(t, &magicSuite{})
}
```

## Write the test

> See also: {ref}`checker`

In `magic1_test.go`, below the test suite, start adding your unit test functions.

The process is as follows: You target some behavior (usually a function) in the code file (in our case, `magic1`). You
then write a test for it, where the test usually follows the same Given, When, Then logic.

For example, suppose your `magic1.go` file defines a simple function called `Sum`:

```go
func Sum(a, b int) int {
return a + b
}
```

Then, in your `magic1_test.go` file you can write a test for it as follows (where `tc.Equals` is
a {ref}`checker <checker>`:

```go
// GIVEN a equals 5 AND b equals 3
// WHEN a and b are summed
// THEN we get 8
func (s *magicSuite) TestSum(c *tc.C) {
a := 5
b := 3

res := magic.Sum(a, b)

c.Assert(res, tc.Equals, 8)
}
```

## Run the test

Finally, to run the test, do:

```bash
go test github.com/juju/juju/x/y/magic/
```

This will run all the tests registered in the `magic` package, including the one we just wrote.

You can also chose to run specific tests or suites, using the normal go test.

## Debug a test

If you need to reproduce a failing test but canâ€™t reproduce it easily, use this script: `juju/scripts/unit-test/stress-race.bash`.

```{tip}
**Where to run?** Running on a small or medium instance on AWS will likely help trigger races more quickly than your local hardware. Particularly useful are instances that shares CPU time -- `t._n_` instances currently. If you locally build the test to
stress you may still need to rsync over the build environment as some tests look for files in the build tree. You'll also need to install mongo.
```

```{tip}
**How many times to run?** It has been noticed that, if the test runs 100 times without failure, things are probably all right.
```
