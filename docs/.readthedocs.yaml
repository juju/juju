# Set the version of Python and other tools you might need
build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04

    python: "3.11"
    golang: latest
  commands:
    # TODO(aflynn): This is a hack, the "commands" config option override the
    # RTD build process completely. This is done so that we can use the "juju
    # documentation" command to auto-generate CLI docs. For this the "juju"
    # command needs to be built and put on the path for the documentation build.
    # Once CLI documentation is autogenerate with a script rather than with
    # "juju documentation" we can call this script from the conf.py instead and
    # use the default RTD build process.

    # Build juju
    - git fetch --unshallow || true
    - mkdir $HOME/_rtd_juju_build
    - GOBIN=$HOME/_rtd_juju_build make juju

    # Install build requirements
    - python -m virtualenv $READTHEDOCS_VIRTUALENV_PATH
    - python -m pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir pip setuptools
    - python -m pip install --exists-action=w --no-cache-dir -r docs/.sphinx/requirements.txt

    # Print config
    - cat docs/conf.py

    # Build sphinx with juju on the PATH.
    - cd docs && PATH=$PATH:$HOME/_rtd_juju_build python -m sphinx -T --keep-going -b dirhtml -d _build/doctrees -D language=en . $READTHEDOCS_OUTPUT/html

# Build documentation in the docs/ directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
  builder: dirhtml
  configuration: docs/conf.py

# If using Sphinx, optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF
formats:
  - pdf

# Optionally declare the Python requirements required to build your docs
python:
