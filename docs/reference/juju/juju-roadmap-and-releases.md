# Juju Roadmap & Releases

> See also: {ref}`upgrade-your-deployment`

This document is about our releases of Juju, that is, the `juju` CLI client and the Juju agents.

- We release new minor version (the 'x' of m.x.p) approcimately every 3 months.
- Patch releases for supported series are released every month
- Once we release a new major version, the latest minor version of the previous release will become an LTS (Long Term Support) release.
- Minor releases are supported with bug fixes for a period of 6 months from their release date, and a further 3 months of security fixes. LTS releases will receive security fixes for 5 years.
- 4.0 is an exception to the rule, as it is still under development. We plan on releasing beta versions that are content driven and not time.

The rest of this document gives detailed information about each release.

### üî∏  **Juju 3.0.0** - 22 Oct 2022

#### What's Changed


##### CLI Changes

**Commands that have been added:**

```text
juju list-operations
juju list-secrets
juju operations
juju secrets
juju show-operation
juju show-secret
juju show-task
juju wait-for
```

**Commands that have been renamed:**

```text

juju integrate (replaces add-relation, relate)
juju model-constraints (replaces get-model-constraints)
juju set-application-base (replaces set-series)

juju sync-agent-binary (replaces sync-tools)

```

**Commands that have been dropped:**

```text
juju add-subnet
juju attach
juju budget
juju cached-images
juju cancel-action
juju charm
juju create-wallet
juju gui
juju hook-tool

juju show-action-output
juju show-action-status
juju show-status
juju show-wallet
juju sla
juju upgrade-dashboard
juju upgrade-gui
juju wallets
```

##### Removal of Juju GUI

Juju GUI is no longer deployed and the --no-gui flag was dropped from juju bootstrap.
The Juju Dashboard replaces the GUI and is deployed using the juju-dashboard charm.


##### Windows charms no longer supported
Windows charms are no longer supported.

##### Bionic and earlier workloads no longer supported
Only workloads on focal and later are supported.

##### No longer create default model on bootstrap
Running juju bootstrap no longer creates a default model. After bootstrap you can use add-model to create a new model to host your workloads.

##### add-k8s helpers for aks, gke, eks
The Juju add-k8s command no longer supports the options "--aks", "--eks", "--gke" for interactive k8s cloud registration. The strict snap cannot execute the external binaries needed to enable this functionality. The options may be added back in a future update.

Note: it's still possible to register AKS, GKE, or EKS clusters by passing the relevant kube config to add-k8s directly.


##### Deprecated traditional kubernetes charms
Traditional kubernetes charms using the pod-spec charm style are deprecated in favor of newer sidecar kubernetes charms.

From juju 3.0, pod-spec charms are pinned to Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) as the base until their removal in a future major version of juju.


##### Rackspace and Cloudsigma providers no longer supported
Rackspace and Cloudsigma providers are no longer supported

#### What's New

##### Juju Dashboard replaces Juju GUI
The Juju Dashboard replaces the GUI; it is deployed via the juju-dashboard charm, which needs to be integrated with the controller application in the controller model.

```
juju bootstrap
juju switch controller
juju deploy juju-dashboard
juju integrate controller juju-dashboard
juju expose juju-dashboard
```

After the juju-dashboard application shows as active, run the dashboard command:

`juju dashboard`

**Note:** the error message which appears if the dashboard is not yet ready needs to be fixed.
([https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1994953](https://bugs.launchpad.net/juju/+bug/1994953))


##### Actions
The client side actions UX has been significantly revamped. See the doc here:
[https://juju.is/docs/olm/manage-actions](https://juju.is/docs/olm/manage-actions)

To understand the changes coming from 2.9 or earlier, see the post here:
[https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/juju-actions-opt-in-to-new-behaviour-from-juju-2-8/2255](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/juju-actions-opt-in-to-new-behaviour-from-juju-2-8/2255)


##### Secrets

It is now possible for charms to create and share secrets across relation data. This avoids the need for sensitive content to be exposed in plain text. The feature is most relevant to charm authors rather than end users, since how charms use secrets is an internal implementation detail for how workloads are configured and managed. Nonetheless, end users can inspect secrets created by deployed charms:

[https://juju.is/docs/olm/secret](https://juju.is/docs/olm/secret)

[https://juju.is/docs/olm/manage-secrets](https://juju.is/docs/olm/manage-secrets)

Charm authors can learn how to use secrets in their charms:

 [https://juju.is/docs/sdk/add-a-secret-to-a-charm](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/add-a-secret-to-a-charm)

[ https://juju.is/docs/sdk/secret-events](https://juju.is/docs/sdk/secret-events)


##### Juju controller application
The controller model has a Juju controller application deployed at bootstrap. This application currently provides integration endpoints for the Juju dashboard charm. Future work will support integration with the COS stack and others.


##### MongoDB server-side transactions now default
Since the move to mongo 4.4 in juju 2.9, juju now uses server-side transactions.

#### Fixes üõ†Ô∏è

- deploy k8s charms to juju 3.0 beta is broken ([LP1947105](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1947105))
- Juju bootstrap failing with various Kubernetes ([LP1905320](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1905320))

This initial release focuses on private registries on Dockerhub, with other public cloud registry support coming in a future release. More details in [this post](https://discourse.charmhub.io/t/initial-private-registry-support/5079).

See the full list in the [milestone page](https://launchpad.net/juju/+milestone/2.9.9).

### üî∏ **Juju 2.9.8** - 13 Jul 2021

This release introduces support for bootstrapping and deploying workloads to **[Equinix](https://www.equinix.com) cloud**. To try out the new provider:

- Run `juju update-public-clouds --client` to ensure that provider API endpoint list is up to date.
- Add a credential for the equinix cloud (`juju add-credential equinix`). You will need to specify your equinix project ID and provide an API key. You can use the equinix [console](https://console.equinix.com) to look up your project ID and generate API tokens.
- Select a metro area and bootstrap a new controller. For example to bootstrap to the Amsterdam data-center you may run the following command: `juju bootstrap equinix/am`.

Caveats:

- Due to substrate limitations, the equinix provider does not implement support for firewalls. As a result, workloads deployed to machines under the same project ID can reach each other even across Juju models.
- Deployed machines are always assigned both a public and a private IP address. This means that any deployed charms are _implicitly exposed_ and proper access control mechanisms need to be implemented to prevent unauthorized access to the deployed workloads.

This release also introduces **logging labels** which will help with the aggregation of logs via a label rather than a namespace.

```
juju model-config "logging-config='#http=TRACE'"
```

The above will turn on HTTP loggers to trace. This is a new UX feature to help with debugging, it's not been full worked through Juju yet and might be subject to change.

üõ†Ô∏è Fixes:

- Juju fails to deploy mysql-k8s charm with its image resource ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1934416))
- Juju 2.9 failing to create ClusterRoleBinding ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1934180))
- Juju interprets `caas-image-repo` containing port number incorrectly ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1934707))

- The `juju ssh --proxy` command is not working on aws when targeting containers with FAN addresses ([LP](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1932547))
