## Details

The register command adds details of a controller to the local system.
This is done either by completing the user registration process that
began with the 'juju add-user' command, or by providing the DNS host
name of a public controller.

To complete the user registration process, you should have been provided
with a base64-encoded blob of data (the output of 'juju add-user')
which can be copied and pasted as the &lt;string&gt; argument to 'register'.
You will be prompted for a password, which, once set, causes the
registration string to be voided. In order to start using Juju the user
can now either add a model or wait for a model to be shared with them.
Some machine providers will require the user to be in possession of
certain credentials in order to add a model.

If a new controller has been spun up to replace an existing one, and you want 
to start using that replacement controller instead of the original one,
use the --replace option to overwrite any existing controller details based
on either a name or UUID match.

When adding a controller at a public address, authentication via some
external third party (for example Ubuntu SSO) will be required, usually
by using a web browser.
