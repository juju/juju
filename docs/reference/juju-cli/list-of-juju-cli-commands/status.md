## Details

Report the model's status, optionally filtered by names of applications or
units. When selectors are present, filter the report to exclude entities that
do not match.

    juju status [<selector> [...]]

&lt;selector&gt; selects machines, units or applications from the model to display.
Wildcard characters (*) enable multiple entities to be matched at the same
time.

    (<machine>|<unit>|<application>)[*]

When an entity that matches &lt;selector&gt; is integrated with other applications, the 
status of those applications will also be presented. By default (without a 
&lt;selector&gt;) the status of all applications and their units will be displayed.


Altering the output format

The '--format' option allows you to specify how the status report is formatted.

  --format=tabular  (default)

  --format=summary
                    Reports aggregated information about the model. Includes 
                    a description of subnets and ports that are in use, the
                    counts of applications, units, and machines by status code.

  --format=json
  --format=yaml
                    Provide information in a JSON or YAML formats for
