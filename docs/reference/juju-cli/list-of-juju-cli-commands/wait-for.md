## Details
The wait-for set of commands (model, application, machine and unit) defines 
a way to wait for a goal state to be reached. The goal state can be defined
programmatically using the query DSL (domain specific language).

The wait-for command is an optimized alternative to the status command for 
determining programmatically if a goal state has been reached. The wait-for
command streams delta changes from the underlying database, unlike the status
command which performs a full query of the database.

The query DSL is a simple language that can be comprised of expressions to
produce a boolean result. The result of the query is used to determine if the
goal state has been reached. The query DSL is evaluated against the scope of
the command.

Built-in functions are provided to help define the goal state. The built-in
functions are defined in the query package. Examples of built-in functions
include len, print, forEach (lambda), startsWith and endsWith.
