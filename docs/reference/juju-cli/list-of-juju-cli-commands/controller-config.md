## Summary
Displays or sets configuration settings for a controller.

## Usage
```juju controller-config [options] [<attribute key>[=<value>] ...]```

### Options
| Flag | Default | Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-B`, `--no-browser-login` | false | Do not use web browser for authentication |
| `-c`, `--controller` |  | Controller to operate in |
| `--color` | false | Use ANSI color codes in output |
| `--file` |  | path to yaml-formatted configuration file |
| `--format` | tabular | Specify output format (json&#x7c;tabular&#x7c;yaml) |
| `--ignore-read-only-fields` | false | Ignore read only fields that might cause errors to be emitted while processing yaml documents |
| `--no-color` | false | Disable ANSI color codes in tabular output |
| `-o`, `--output` |  | Specify an output file |

## Examples

Print all config values for the current controller:

    juju controller-config

Print the value of "api-port" for the current controller:

    juju controller-config api-port

Print all config values for the controller "mycontroller":

    juju controller-config -c mycontroller

Set the "auditing-enabled" and "audit-log-max-backups" keys:

    juju controller-config auditing-enabled=true audit-log-max-backups=5

Set the current controller's config from a yaml file:

    juju controller-config --file path/to/file.yaml


## Details

To view all configuration values for the current controller, run
    juju controller-config
You can target a specific controller using the -c flag:
    juju controller-config -c <controller>
By default, the config will be printed in a tabular format. You can instead
print it in json or yaml format using the --format flag:
    juju controller-config --format json
    juju controller-config --format yaml

To view the value of a single config key, run
    juju controller-config key
To set config values, run
    juju controller-config key1=val1 key2=val2 ...

Config values can be imported from a yaml file using the --file flag:
    juju controller-config --file=path/to/cfg.yaml
This allows you to e.g. save a controller's config to a file:
    juju controller-config --format=yaml > cfg.yaml
and then import the config later. Note that the output of controller-config
may include read-only values, which will cause an error when importing later.
To prevent the error, use the --ignore-read-only-fields flag:
    juju controller-config --file=cfg.yaml --ignore-read-only-fields

You can also read from stdin using "-", which allows you to pipe config values
from one controller to another:
    juju controller-config -c c1 --format=yaml \
      | juju controller-config -c c2 --file=- --ignore-read-only-fields
You can simultaneously read config from a yaml file and set config keys
as above. The command-line args will override any values specified in the file.
