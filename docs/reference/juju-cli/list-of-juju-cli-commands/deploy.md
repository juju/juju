## Details

A charm or bundle can be referred to by its simple name and a base, revision,
or channel can optionally be specified:

    juju deploy postgresql
    juju deploy ch:postgresql --base ubuntu@22.04
    juju deploy ch:postgresql --channel edge
    juju deploy ch:ubuntu --revision 17 --channel edge

All the above deployments use remote charms found in Charmhub, denoted by the
'ch:' prefix.  Remote charms with no prefix will be deployed from Charmhub.

If a channel is specified, it will be used as the source for looking up the
charm or bundle from Charmhub. When used in a bundle deployment context,
the specified channel is only used for retrieving the bundle and is ignored when
looking up the charms referenced by the bundle. However, each charm within a
bundle is allowed to explicitly specify the channel used to look it up.

If a revision is specified, a channel must also be specified for Charmhub charms
and bundles.  The charm will be deployed with revision.  The channel will be used
when refreshing the application in the future.

A local charm may be deployed by giving the path to its directory:

    juju deploy /path/to/charm
    juju deploy /path/to/charm --base ubuntu@22.04

You will need to be explicit if there is an ambiguity between a local and a
remote charm:

    juju deploy ./pig
    juju deploy ch:pig

A bundle can be expressed similarly to a charm:

    juju deploy mediawiki-single
    juju deploy mediawiki-single --base ubuntu@22.04
    juju deploy ch:mediawiki-single

A local bundle may be deployed by specifying the path to its YAML file:

    juju deploy /path/to/bundle.yaml

The final charm/machine base is determined using an order of precedence (most
preferred to least):

- the `--base` command option
- for a bundle, the series stated in each charm URL (in the bundle file)
- for a bundle, the series given at the top level (in the bundle file)
- the 'default-base' model key
- the first base specified in the charm's manifest file

An 'application name' provides an alternate name for the application. It works
only for charms; it is silently ignored for bundles (although the same can be
done at the bundle file level). Such a name must consist only of lower-case
letters (a-z), numbers (0-9), and single hyphens (-). The name must begin with
a letter and not have a group of all numbers follow a hyphen:

- Valid:  `myappname`, `custom-app`, `app2-scat-23skidoo`
- Invalid: `myAppName`, `custom--app`, `app2-scat-23`, `areacode-555-info`

Use the `--constraints` option to specify hardware requirements for new machines.
These become the application's default constraints (i.e. they are used if the
application is later scaled out with the `add-unit` command). To overcome this
behaviour use the `set-constraints` command to change the application's default
constraints or add a machine (`add-machine`) with a certain constraint and then
target that machine with `add-unit` by using the `--to`option.

Use the `--device` option to specify GPU device requirements (with Kubernetes).
The below format is used for this option's value, where the 'label' is named in
the charm metadata file:

    <label>=[<count>,]<device-class>|<vendor/type>[,<attributes>]

Use the `--config` option to specify application configuration values. This
option accepts either a path to a YAML-formatted file or a key=value pair. A
file should be of this format:

    <charm name>:
      <option name>: <option value>
	...

For example, to deploy 'mediawiki' with file 'mycfg.yaml' that contains:

    mediawiki:
	  name: my media wiki
	  admins: me:pwdOne
	  debug: true

use

    juju deploy mediawiki --config mycfg.yaml

Key=value pairs can also be passed directly in the command. For example, to
declare the 'name' key:

    juju deploy mediawiki --config name='my media wiki'

To define multiple keys:

    juju deploy mediawiki --config name='my media wiki' --config debug=true

If a key gets defined multiple times the last value will override any earlier
values. For example,

    juju deploy mediawiki --config name='my media wiki' --config mycfg.yaml

Similar to the `juju config` command, if the value begins with an '@' character,
it will be treated as a path to a config file and its contents will be assigned
to the specified key. For example,

    juju deploy mediawiki --config name='@wiki-name.txt"

will set the 'name' key to the contents of file 'wiki-name.txt'.

If mycfg.yaml contains a value for 'name', it will override the earlier 'my
media wiki' value. The same applies to single value options. For example,

    juju deploy mediawiki --config name='a media wiki' --config name='my wiki'

the value of 'my wiki' will be used.

Use the `--resource` option to specify the resources you want to use for your charm.
The format is

    --resource <resource name>=<resource>

where the resource name is the name from the metadata.yaml file of the charm
and where, depending on the type of the resource, the resource can be specified
as follows: 

(1) If the resource is type 'file', you can specify it by providing
  (a) the resource revision number or
  (b) a path to a local file.

(2) If the resource is type 'oci-image', you can specify it by providing
  (a) the resource revision number,
  (b) a path to a local file = private OCI image,
  (c) a link to a public OCI image.


Note: If you choose (1b) or (2b-c), i.e., a resource that is not from Charmhub:
You will not be able to go back to using a resource from Charmhub.

Note: If you choose (1b) or (2b): This uploads a file from your loal disk to the juju
controller to be streamed to the charm when "resource-get" is called by a hook.

Note: If you choose (2b): You will need to specify:
(i) the local path to the private OCI image as well as
(ii) the username/password required to access the private OCI image.

Note: If multiple resources are needed, repeat the option.


Use the `--to` option to deploy to an existing machine or container by
specifying a "placement directive". The `status` command should be used for
guidance on how to refer to machines. A few placement directives are
provider-dependent (e.g.: 'zone').

In more complex scenarios, "network spaces" are used to partition the cloud
networking layer into sets of subnets. Instances hosting units inside the same
space can communicate with each other without any firewalls. Traffic crossing
space boundaries could be subject to firewall and access restrictions. Using
spaces as deployment targets, rather than their individual subnets, allows Juju
to perform automatic distribution of units across availability zones to support
high availability for applications. Spaces help isolate applications and their
units, both for security purposes and to manage both traffic segregation and
congestion.

When deploying an application or adding machines, the 'spaces' constraint can
be used to define a comma-delimited list of required and forbidden spaces (the
latter prefixed with '^', similar to the 'tags' constraint).

When deploying bundles, machines specified in the bundle are added to the model
as new machines. Use the `--map-machines=existing` option to make use of any
existing machines. To map particular existing machines to machines defined in
the bundle, multiple comma separated values of the form 'bundle-id=existing-id'
can be passed. For example, for a bundle that specifies machines 1, 2, and 3;
and a model that has existing machines 1, 2, 3, and 4, the below deployment
would have existing machines 1 and 2 assigned to machines 1 and 2 defined in
the bundle and have existing machine 4 assigned to machine 3 defined in the
bundle.

    juju deploy mybundle --map-machines=existing,3=4

Only top level machines can be mapped in this way, just as only top level
machines can be defined in the machines section of the bundle.

When charms that include LXD profiles are deployed the profiles are validated
for security purposes by allowing only certain configurations and devices. Use
the `--force` option to bypass this check. Doing so is not recommended as it
can lead to unexpected behaviour.
