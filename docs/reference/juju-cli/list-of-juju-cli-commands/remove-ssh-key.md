## Details
Juju maintains a per-model cache of public SSH keys which it copies to
each unit. This command will remove a specified key (or space separated
list of keys) from the model cache and all current units deployed in that
model. The keys to be removed may be specified by the key's fingerprint,
or by the text label associated with them. Invalid keys in the model cache
can be removed by specifying the key verbatim.
