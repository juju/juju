# Google GKE

In Juju, [Google GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs) is a {ref}`Kubernetes cloud <kubernetes-cloud>`. It behaves like all Kubernetes clouds, except for a few points of variation related to the cloud, described below.

## The cloud

```

### Adding the cloud

When adding this cloud to Juju using the {ref}`juju CLI client <juju-client>`, starting with Juju 3.0 you must run the `add-k8s` command with the 'raw' client because the `juju` client snap is strictly confined but the GKE cloud CLI snap is not.
