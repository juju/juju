# Amazon EKS

In Juju, [Amazon EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/index.html) is a {ref}`Kubernetes cloud <kubernetes-cloud>`. It behaves like all {ref}`Kubernetes clouds <kubernetes-cloud>`, except for a few points of variation related to the cloud, described below.

```

### Adding the cloud

When adding this cloud to Juju using the {ref}`juju CLI client <juju-client>`, starting with Juju 3.0 you must run the `add-k8s` command with the 'raw' client because the `juju` client snap is strictly confined but the EKS cloud CLI snap is not.
