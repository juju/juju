# The LXD cloud and Juju

<!--To see the older HTG-style doc, see version 39. Note that it may be out-of-date. -->

<!--
LXD is a hypervisor that provides system containers that are secure, lightweight, and easy to use. When your computer has LXD installed, Juju can operate the `localhost` cloud.
-->

This document describes details specific to using your existing LXD cloud with Juju.


````{dropdown} Expand to view how to get a LXD cloud quickly on Ubuntu

Your Ubuntu likely comes with LXD preinstalled. Configure it as below. Juju will then recognize it as the `localhost` cloud.

```text
lxd init --auto
lxc network set lxdbr0 ipv6.address none
```

```{dropdown} Expand to view some reasons to use a LXD cloud

The LXD cloud, especially when used locally, is great for: <p> - creating a repeatable deployment: Juju enables you to quickly iterate to construct the optimal deployment for your situation, then distribute that across your team <p> -- local development: Juju's localhost cloud can mirror the production ops environment (without incurring the costs involved with duplicating it) <p> - learning Juju: LXD is a lightweight tool for exploring Juju and how it operates <p> - rapid prototyping: LXD is great for when you're creating a new charm and want to be able to quickly provision capacity and tear it down

```

```{dropdown} Expand to find out why Docker wouldn't work

Juju expects to see an operating system-like environment, so a LXD system container fits the bill. Docker containers are laid out for a singular application process, with a self-contained filesystem rather than a base userspace image.

```

## Requirements

Juju `2.9.x`: LXD `5.0`<p> Juju `3.x.x`: LXD `5.x`

## Notes on `juju add-cloud`

Type in Juju: `lxd`

Name in Juju: `localhost`

## Notes on `juju add-credential`

**local LXD cloud:** If you are a Juju admin user: Already known to Juju. Run `juju bootstrap`, then `juju credentials` to confirm. (Pre-defined credential name in Juju: `localhost`.) Otherwise: Add manually as you would a remote. <p> **clustered LXD cloud**: In Juju, this counts as a remote cloud. You must add its definition to Juju explicitly. <p> **remote LXD cloud:** Requires the API endpoint URL for the remote LXD server.

### Authentication types

#### `certificate`
Attributes:
- `server-cert`: the path to the PEM-encoded LXD server certificate file (required)
- `client-cert`: the path to the PEM-encoded LXD client certificate file (required)
- `client-key`: the path to the PEM-encoded LXD client key file (required)

#### `interactive`
Attributes:
- `trust-token`: the LXD server trust token (optional, required if trust-password is not set).
<br>This is the recommended method for authenticating with a remote LXD server (see [LXD \| Adding client certificates using tokens](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/en/stable-5.0/authentication/#adding-client-certificates-using-tokens)).
<br>(Added in Juju 3.6.4)
- `trust-password`: the LXD server trust password (optional, required if trust-token is not set)

## Supported constraints

```{note}
With LXD system containers, constraints are interpreted as resource *maximums* (as opposed to *minimums*). <p> There is a 1:1 correspondence between a Juju machine and a LXD container. Compare `juju machines` and `lxc list`.

## Notes on generic storage providers

(loop-devices-and-lxd)=
### Loop devices and LXD

LXD (localhost) does not officially support attaching loopback devices for storage out of the box. However, with some configuration you can make this work.

Each container uses the 'default' LXD profile, but also uses a model-specific profile with the name `juju-<model-name>-<model-short-UUID>` where `<model-short-UUID>` is the first 6 characters of the model UUID. Editing a profile will affect all of the containers using it, so you can add loop devices to all LXD containers by editing the 'default' profile, or you can scope it to a model.

To add loop devices to your container, add entries to the 'default', or model-specific, profile, with `lxc profile edit <profile>`:

``` yaml
...
devices:
  loop-control:
    major: "10"
    minor: "237"
    path: /dev/loop-control
    type: unix-char
  loop0:
    major: "7"
    minor: "0"
    path: /dev/loop0
    type: unix-block
  loop1:
    major: "7"
    minor: "1"
    path: /dev/loop1
    type: unix-block
...
  loop9:
    major: "7"
    minor: "9"
    path: /dev/loop9
    type: unix-block
```

Doing so will expose the loop devices so the container can acquire them via the `losetup` command. However, it is not sufficient to enable the container to mount filesystems onto the loop devices. One way to achieve that is to make the container "privileged" by adding:

``` yaml
config:
  security.privileged: "true"
```

## Cloud-specific storage providers

```{ibnote}
See first: {ref}`storage-provider`
```

(storage-provider-lxd)=
### `lxd`

Configuration options:

- `driver`: This is the LXD storage driver (e.g. `zfs`, `btrfs`, `lvm`, `ceph`).

- `lxd-pool`:  The name to give to the corresponding storage pool in LXD.

Any other parameters will be passed to LXD (e.g. zfs.pool_name). See upstream [LXD storage configuration](https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/doc/storage.md) for LXD storage parameters.

Every LXD-based model comes with a minimum of one LXD-specific Juju storage pool called 'lxd'. If ZFS and/or BTRFS are present when the controller is created then pools 'lxd-zfs' and/or 'lxd-btrfs' will also be available. The following output to the `juju storage-pools` command shows all three Juju LXD-specific pools:

```bash
Name       Provider  Attributes
loop       loop
lxd        lxd
lxd-btrfs  lxd       driver=btrfs lxd-pool=juju-btrfs
lxd-zfs    lxd       driver=zfs lxd-pool=juju-zfs zfs.pool_name=juju-lxd
rootfs     rootfs
tmpfs      tmpfs
```

As can be inferred from the above output, for each Juju storage pool based on the `lxd` storage provider, there is a LXD storage pool that gets created. It is these LXD pools that will house the actual volumes.

The LXD pool corresponding to the Juju `lxd` pool doesn't get created until the latter is used for the first time (typically via the `juju deploy` command). It is called simply `juju`.

The command `lxc storage list` is used to list LXD storage pools. A full "contingent" of LXD non-custom storage pools would look like this:

```text
+------------+-------------+--------+------------------------------------+---------+
|    NAME    | DESCRIPTION | DRIVER |               SOURCE               | USED BY |
+------------+-------------+--------+------------------------------------+---------+
| default    |             | dir    | /var/lib/lxd/storage-pools/default | 1       |
+------------+-------------+--------+------------------------------------+---------+
| juju       |             | dir    | /var/lib/lxd/storage-pools/juju    | 0       |
+------------+-------------+--------+------------------------------------+---------+
| juju-btrfs |             | btrfs  | /var/lib/lxd/disks/juju-btrfs.img  | 0       |
+------------+-------------+--------+------------------------------------+---------+
| juju-zfs   |             | zfs    | /var/lib/lxd/disks/juju-zfs.img    | 0       |
+------------+-------------+--------+------------------------------------+---------+
```

The three Juju-related pools above are for storing *volumes* that Juju applications can use. The fourth 'default' pool is the standard LXD storage pool where the actual *containers* (operating systems) live.

To deploy an application, refer to the pool as usual. Here we deploy PostgreSQL using the `lxd` Juju storage pool, which, in turn, uses the `juju` LXD storage pool:

```text
juju deploy postgresql --storage pgdata=lxd,8G
```

## Other notes

### Simple bootstrap of a remote LXD server

From Juju 2.9.5, the easiest method for bootstrapping a remote LXD server is to add the remote to your local LXC config then bootstrap with `juju`.

On the remote server:
```bash
# ensure the LXD daemon is listening on an accessible IP
lxc config set core.https_address '{ref}`::]'
# give the LXD daemon a trust password so the client can register credentials
lxc config set core.trust_password mytrustpassword
```

On the bootstrapping client:
```bash
# add the remote LXD server to the local LXC config
lxc remote add myremote 11.22.33.44 --password mytrustpassword
# bootstrap juju using the remote name in LXC
juju bootstrap myremote
```

```{note}
The bootstrapping client must be able to reach the remote LXD containers. This may require the setup of a bridge device with the hosts ethernet device.
```

### Non-admin user credentials

See {ref}`manage-credentials` for more details on how Juju credentials are used to share a bootstrapped controller.

To share a LXD server with other users on the same machine or remotely, the best method is to use LXC remotes. See "Simple bootstrap of a remote LXD server" above.

### Add resilience via LXD clustering

LXD clustering provides the ability for applications to be deployed in a high-availability manner. In a clustered LXD cloud, Juju will deploy units across its nodes. See more: [LXD | Clustering](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/lxd/stable-5.21/clustering/).

### Use LXD profiles from a charm

LXD Profiles allows the definition of a configuration that can be applied to any instance. Juju can apply those profiles during the creation or modification of a LXD container. See more: [Charmcraft | `lxd-profile.yaml](https://canonical-charmcraft.readthedocs-hosted.com/stable/reference/files/lxd-profile-yaml-file/).

### LXD images

LXD is image based: All LXD containers come from images and any LXD daemon instance (also called a "remote") can serve images. When LXD is installed a locally-running remote is provided (Unix domain socket) and the client is configured to talk to it (named 'local'). The client is also configured to talk to several other, non-local, ones (named 'ubuntu', 'ubuntu-daily', and 'images').

An image is identified by its fingerprint (SHA-256 hash), and can be tagged with multiple aliases.

For any image-related command, an image is specified by its alias or by its fingerprint. Both are shown in image lists. An image's *filename* is its *full* fingerprint, while an image *list* displays its *partial* fingerprint. Either type of fingerprint can be used to refer to images.

Juju pulls official cloud images from the 'ubuntu' remote (http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com) and creates the necessary alias. Any subsequent requests will be satisfied by the LXD cache (`/var/lib/lxd/images`).

Image cache expiration and image synchronization mechanisms are built-in.
