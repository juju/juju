# Pebble

**Pebble** is a lightweight, API-driven process supervisor. When Juju provisions resources on a Kubernetes cloud, Pebble is automatically injected into each container, where it acts like an `init` system, and  charm interacts with its workload through the workload container's Pebble.

## Pebble notices

In Pebble, a **notice** is an aggregated event to record when custom events happen in the workload container or in Pebble itself.

Pebble notices are supported in Juju starting with version 3.4. Juju polls each workload container's Pebble server for new notices, and fires an event to the charm when a notice first occurs as well as each time it repeats.

Each notice has a *type* and *key*, the combination of which uniquely identifies it. A notice's count of occurrences is incremented every time a notice with that type and key combination occurs.

Currently, the only notice type is "custom". These are custom notices recorded by a user of Pebble; in future, other notice types may be recorded by Pebble itself. When a custom notice occurs, Juju fires a [`PebbleCustomNoticeEvent`](https://ops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/ops.html#ops.PebbleCustomNoticeEvent) event whose [`workload`](https://ops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/ops.html#ops.WorkloadEvent.workload) attribute is set to the relevant container.

Custom notices allow the workload to wake up the charm when something interesting happens with the workload, for example, when a PostgreSQL backup process finishes, or some kind of alert occurs.
