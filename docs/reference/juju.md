# Juju

When you install Juju (e.g., via `snap install juju`), you get the `juju` CLI client as well as the agent binaries that will be used to set up agents in the entities you spin up using the client and then the controller. This document describes the whole thing -- from releases to component cross-version compatibility to a typical deployment architecture.
