# Model
```{ibnote}
See also: {ref}`manage-models`
```

In Juju, a **model**  is an abstraction that holds {ref}`applications <application>` and application supporting components -- {ref}`machines <machine>`, {ref}`storage <storage>`, {ref}`network spaces <space>`, {ref}`relations <relation>`, etc.

A model is created by a {ref}`user <user>`, and owned in perpetuity by that user (or a new user with the same name), though it may also be used by any other user with model access level, within the limits of their level.

A model is created on a {ref}`controller <controller>`.  Both the model and the controller are associated with a {ref}`cloud <cloud>` (and a cloud {ref}`credential <credential>`), though they do not both have to be on the same cloud (this is a scenario where you have a 'multicloud controller' and where you may have 'cross-model relations (integrations)'). Any entities added to the model will use resources from that cloud.

One can deploy multiple applications to the same model. Thus, models allow the logical grouping of applications and infrastructure that work together to deliver a service or product.  Moreover, one can apply common {ref}`configurations <configuration>` to a whole model. As such, models allow the low-level storage, compute, network and software components to be reasoned about as a single entity as well.

## Model taxonomy

Models are of two types:

1. **The controller model (`controller`).** This is your Juju management model. A Juju deployment will have just one controller model, which is created by default when you create a controller (`juju bootstrap`). It typically contains a single machine, for the controller (since Juju `3.0`, the `controller` application). If controller {ref}`high availability <high-availability>` is enabled, then the controller model would contain multiple instances. The `controller` model may also contain certain applications which it makes sense to deploy near the controller -- e.g., starting with Juju `3.0`, the `juju-dashboard` application.

2. **Regular model.** This is your Juju workload model. A Juju deployment may have many different workload models, which you create manually (`juju add-model`). It is the model where you typically deploy your applications.

## Model configuration

A model configuration is a rule or a set of rules that define the behavior of a model -- including the `controller` model.

## Model lifecycle

### Model removal

A model is destroyed with `juju destroy-model`. Destruction is the
largest removal and runs the same cooperative pattern at scale: the
controller marks the model Dying and wakes the Undertaker worker,
which tears the model down in dependency order -- applications first,
then the machines, and the model's Dqlite database last, as the final
act after all cloud resources are released. The controller never
deletes its own database -- the Undertaker does.

```{ggarch}
:file: ../juju.ggarch
:sequence: Model removal
:alt: User calls juju destroy-model. Controller marks model Dying and fires watcher to Undertaker. Undertaker destroys all applications. Controller releases all machines and marks model Dead. Undertaker deletes model records and Dqlite database.
:caption: Model destruction, the largest removal, runs the same pattern at scale: the Undertaker worker inside the controller agent tears everything down in dependency order. The controller never deletes its own database -- the Undertaker does, as the final act after all cloud resources are released.
