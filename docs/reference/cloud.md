To Juju, a **cloud** (or backing cloud) is any entity that has an API that can provide compute, networking, and optionally storage resources in order for application units to be deployed on them. This includes public clouds such as Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure and Kubernetes as well as private OpenStack-based clouds. Juju can also make use of environments which are not clouds per se, but which Juju can nonetheless treat as a cloud. MAAS and LXD fit into this last category. Because of this, in Juju a cloud is sometimes also called, more generally, a **substrate**.

## Cloud differences

While Juju aims to make all clouds feel the same, some differences still persist depending on whether the cloud is a machine cloud or a Kubernetes cloud or a specific cloud as opposed to another.

```{dropdown} Expand to view an example featuring the Amazon EC2 cloud


The Amazon EC2 cloud is a machine cloud, so you connect it to Juju via `add-cloud` + `add-credential`. However, it's a public cloud, so Juju can get its definition for you, so you can skip `add-cloud` -- Juju already knows this cloud as `aws`. Still, when you do `add-credential`, you have to use the cloud-specific authentication type, which in this case requires you to provide your access key and secret key. Because it's a machine cloud, that means you can make your controller high-availability; also, you can clone your controller's configuration into a new controller via `juju create-backup` and the stand-alone tool `juju-restore`; however, you can only deploy machine charms; and, to scale an application, you can't do `scale-application` -- you must do `add-unit`. However, because it's AWS EC2 you can use instance roles. Etc.

```

(machine-clouds-vs-kubernetes-clouds)=
### Machine clouds vs. Kubernetes clouds

Juju makes a fundamental distinction between **'machine' clouds** -- that is, clouds based on bare metal machines (BMs; e.g., MAAS), virtual machines (VMs; e.g., AWS EC2), or system containers (e.g., LXD) -- and **'Kubernetes' clouds** -- that is, based on containers (e.g., AWS EKS).

> See more: {ref}`machine`

While the user experience is still mostly the same -- bootstrap a Juju controller into the cloud, add a model, deploy charms, scale, upgrade, etc. -- this difference affects:
 - the required system requirements (e.g., for a Juju controller, 4GB vs. 6GB memory)
- the way you connect the cloud to Juju (`add-cloud` + `add-credentials` vs. `add-k8s`)
- what charms you can deploy ('machine' charms vs. 'Kubernetes' charms)

and, occasionally

- what operations you may perform, e.g.,
    - `enable-ha` is currently supported just for machine controllers
    - scaling an application is done via `add-unit` on machines and via `scale-application` on K8s).

> See more:  {ref}`tutorial`, {ref}`how-to-guides`

Juju's vision is to eventually make this distinction irrelevant.


<!--REMOVE THIS BECAUSE Attempts to classify into public/private, remote/local are confusing. E.g., by public people usually mean Amazon, Google, or Azure, but that's just branded or commercial public -- any other cloud can be public if you just provide it with a static IP and share it. And the remote/local distinction is entangled with it as well -- a personal 'public' cloud is local to you though remote to whoever you're sharing it with. Juju fundamentally just cares about machine vs. K8s. For 'public' it cares only in the sense that you can skip add-cloud for Amazon EC2, Equinix Metal, Google GCE, Microsoft Azure, and ; even there, for aws-gov you do actually have to do add-cloud, and for the rest it doesn't harm to do add-cloud -- it's just not necessary. Also in the sense that we have an update-public-clouds command, but it's not even clear if that does anything for public clouds other than aws, google, and azure, so we might be better off minimizing it, e.g., by turning that command into a flag or something. The only distinction we should introduce prominently is machine vs. K8s, and we should introduce it via our tutorial and HTGs. The smaller differences are inevitable accidents of the fact that cloud foo is not cloud bar, and they will always affect the information you need to supply in the cloud registration step and also the availability of certain constraints, configs, etc.

<a href="#heading--public-clouds-vs--private-local---remote-clouds"><h3 id="heading--public-clouds-vs--private-local---remote-clouds">Public clouds vs. private local / remote clouds</h3></a>

Juju differentiates slightly between **public** and **private** **local** / **remote** clouds in the sense that it will try to anticipate and help you skip steps wherever possible.

From the point of view of a user, this mostly just affects whether you can skip certain steps in the setup phase. For example, if your cloud is a public machine cloud / a local private machine or Kubernetes cloud, and you are a Juju controller `superuser` (the typical case), Juju knows where to retrieve the definition for your cloud / your cloud credentials, so you don't have to provide them to Juju manually.

(cloud-foo-vs-cloud-bar)=
### Cloud foo vs. cloud bar

As a Juju user you will sometimes also notice small differences tied to a cloud's specific identity, beyond the machine-Kubernetes divide.

This usually affects the setup phase (the information you have to supply to Juju to connect Juju to your cloud, and whether Juju can retrieve any of that automatically for you) and, later on, the customisations you can make to your deployment (e.g., small differences in configurations, constraints, placement directives, subnets, spaces, storage, etc., depending on the features available / supported for a given cloud).

> See more: {ref}`list-of-supported-clouds` > `<cloud name>`

However, note that all Kubernetes clouds are fundamentally the same.

(cloud-definition)=
## Cloud definition

In Juju, cloud definitions can be provided either interactively or via a YAML file or (depending on the cloud) environment variables.

Regardless of the method, they are saved in a file called `public-clouds.yaml` (for public clouds; on Linux, typically: `~/.local/share/juju/public-clouds.yaml`) or `clouds.yaml` (for user-defined clouds, including Kubernetes; on Linux, the default location is: `~/.local/share/juju/clouds.yaml`).

These files both follow the same basic schema.


<!--
The `clouds.yaml` file is the file in your Juju installation where Juju stores your cloud definitions. This includes definitions that Juju has already (e.g., for public clouds) as well as any definitions you have provided yourself, either interactively (by typing `juju add-cloud` and then following the interactive prompts) or manually (either via a YAML file or via environment variables).

This schema is the same across all clouds,

(1) `auth-types` -- the specific list may vary from cloud to cloud.

(2) `config` -- while the generic model configuration keys are the same across clouds, the cloud-specific keys will naturally vary.
