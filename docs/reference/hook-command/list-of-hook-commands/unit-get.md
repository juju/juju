## Details

Further details:
unit-get returns the IP address of the unit.

It accepts a single argument, which must be
private-address or public-address. It is not
affected by context.

Note that if a unit has been deployed with
--bind space then the address returned from
unit-get private-address will get the address
from this space, not the ‘default’ space.
