# The purpose of this workflow file is to confirm that the Sphinx
# virtual environment can be built from source, consequently documenting
# the packages required in the build environment to do that.
#
# This is needed because some projects embeds the documentation into built
# artifacts which involves rendering the documentation on the target
# architecture.
#
# Depending on the architecture, pip may or may not have already built wheels
# available, and as such we need to make sure building wheels from source can
# succeed.
