/*
Package backups contains all the stand-alone backup-related
functionality for juju state. That functionality is encapsulated by
the backups.Backups type. The package also exposes a few key helpers
and components.

Backups are not a part of juju state nor of normal state operations.
However, they certainly are tightly coupled with state (the very
subject of backups). This puts backups in an odd position, particularly
with regard to the storage of backup metadata and archives.

As noted above backups are about state but not a part of state. So
exposing backup-related methods on State would imply the wrong thing.
Thus most of the functionality here is defined at a high level without
relation to state. A few low-level parts or helpers are exposed as
functions to which you pass a state value. Those are kept to a minimum.

Note that state (and juju as a whole) currently does not have a
persistence layer abstraction to facilitate separating different
persistence needs and implementations. As a consequence, state's
data, whether about how an model should look or about existing
resources within an model, is dumped essentially straight into
State's mongo connection. The code in the state package does not
make any distinction between the two (nor does the package clearly
distinguish between state-related abstractions and state-related
data).

Backups add yet another category, merely taking advantage of State's
mongo for storage. In the interest of making the distinction clear,
among other reasons, backups uses its own database under state's mongo
connection.
