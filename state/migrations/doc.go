// Package migrations aims to create an intermidiate state between state and the
// description package. One that aims to correctly model the dependencies
// required for migration.
//
// This package is in a state of transition, from the traditional way in the
// state package and the new way in this migrations package. It's likely to be
// a slow, considered move between the two and until all migrations are moved
// to here, there could be additional complexities. Once that is done, a new
// look to simplify any complexities which came up during the move is probably
// wise.
//
// Concept:
//  The key concept is to remove code (complexities) from the state package that
//  could be easily modelled somewhere else.
//
// Steps:
//  - Create a new Migration that can perform the execution.
//  - Create a source (src) and destination (dst) point of use interface
//  - Migrate from source to destination models.
