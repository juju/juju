// allCollections should be the single source of truth for information about
// any collection we use. It's broken up into 4 main sections:
//
//  * infrastructure: we really don't have any business touching these once
//    we've created them. They should have the rawAccess attribute set, so that
//    multiModelRunner will consider them forbidden.
//
//  * global: these hold information external to models. They may include
//    model metadata, or references; but they're generally not relevant
//    from the perspective of a given model.
//
//  * local (in opposition to global; and for want of a better term): these
//    hold information relevant *within* specific models (machines,
//    applications, relations, settings, bookkeeping, etc) and should generally be
//    read via an modelStateCollection, and written via a multiModelRunner. This is
//    the most common form of collection, and the above access should usually
//    be automatic via Database.Collection and Database.Runner.
//
//  * raw-access: there's certainly data that's a poor fit for mgo/txn. Most
//    forms of logs, for example, will benefit both from the speedy insert and
//    worry-free bulk deletion; so raw-access collections are fine. Just don't
//    try to run transactions that reference them.
//
// Please do not use collections not referenced here; and when adding new
// collections, please document them, and make an effort to put them in an
// appropriate section.
